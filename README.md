## Project documentation classifier

This repo keeps the code and steps towards building a classifier that identifies pieces of information that are relevant for newcomers to automatically summarize it.

At this point we are working on classifying the information. Next steps include creating a summarizer and automatically feeding FLOSScoach to structure the information in an easy-to-follow way.

This research is conducted by @fronchetti, under the supervision of @igorwiese and @igorsteinmacher

How does our approach work?
