For Glide v3, see the [wiki][2].

Simple use cases will look something like this:

```java
// For a simple view:
@Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  ...
  ImageView imageView = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.my_image_view);

  Glide.with(this).load(""http://goo.gl/gEgYUd"").into(imageView);

// For a simple image list:
@Override public View getView(int position, View recycled, ViewGroup container) {
  final ImageView myImageView;
  if (recycled == null) {
    myImageView = (ImageView) inflater.inflate(R.layout.my_image_view, container, false);
  } else {
    myImageView = (ImageView) recycled;
  }

  String url = myUrls.get(position);

  Glide
    .with(myFragment)

"Status
------
Version 4 is now released and stable. Updates are released periodically with new features and bug fixes.

Comments/bugs/questions/pull requests are always welcome! Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md][5] on how to report issues.",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,ufpa,group_h,bumptech_glide.xlsx,12,README
"Compatibility
-------------

 * **Minimum Android SDK**: Glide v4 requires a minimum API level of 14.
 * **Compile Android SDK**: Glide v4 requires you to compile against API 26 or later.

 If you need to support older versions of Android, consider staying on [Glide v3][14], which works on API 10, but is not actively maintained.

 * **OkHttp 3.x**: There is an optional dependency available called `okhttp3-integration`, see the [docs page][23].
 * **Volley**: There is an optional dependency available called `volley-integration`, see the [docs page][24].
 * **Round Pictures**: `CircleImageView`/`CircularImageView`/`RoundedImageView` are known to have [issues][18] with `TransitionDrawable` (`.crossFade()` with `.thumbnail()` or `.placeholder()`) and animated GIFs, use a [`BitmapTransformation`][19] (`.circleCrop()` will be available in v4) or `.dontAnimate()` to fix the issue.
 * **Huge Images** (maps, comic strips): Glide can load huge images by downsampling them, but does not support zooming and panning `ImageView`s as they require special resource optimizations (such as tiling) to work without `OutOfMemoryError`s.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,ufpa,group_h,bumptech_glide.xlsx,13,README
"Build
-----
Building Glide with gradle is fairly straight forward:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bumptech/glide.git
cd glide
./gradlew jar
```

**Note**: Make sure your *Android SDK* has the *Android Support Repository* installed, and that your `$ANDROID_HOME` environment
variable is pointing at the SDK or add a `local.properties` file in the root project with a `sdk.dir=...` line.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,ufpa,group_h,bumptech_glide.xlsx,14,README

Labels on issues are managed by contributors, you don't have to worry about them. Here's a list of what they mean:

 * **bug**: feature that should work, but doesn't
 * **enhancement**: minor tweak/addition to existing behavior
 * **feature**: new behavior, bigger than enhancement, it gives more bang to Glide
 * **question**: no need to modify Glide to fix the issue, usually a usage problem
 * **reproducible**: has enough information to very easily reproduce, mostly in form of a small project in a GitHub repo
 * **repro-needed**: we need some code to be able to reproduce and debug locally, otherwise there's not much we can do
 * **duplicate**: there's another issue which already covers/tracks this
 * **wontfix**: working as intended, or won't be fixed due to compatibility or other reasons
 * **invalid**: there isn't enough information to make a verdict, or unrelated to Glide
 * **non-library**: issue is not in the core library code, but rather in documentation, samples, build process, releases
 * **v4**: problem originated in v4, or question about v4 (while v3 is in wide use)

*bug + enhancement: feature that doesn't work, but it's an edge case that either has a workaround or doesn't affect many users*",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_h,bumptech_glide.xlsx,9,CONTRIBUTING

"## Philosophy

  The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making
  it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public
  HTTP APIs.

  Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over
  14 template engines via [Consolidate.js](https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js),
  you can quickly craft your perfect framework.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_15,strongloop_express.xlsx,15,README
"## Examples

  To view the examples, clone the Express repo and install the dependencies:

```bash

$ cd express
$ npm install

Before reporting a bug on the project's [issues page](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues),

 * Include **browser, OS and Leaflet version** info in the description.
 * Create a **simple test case** that demonstrates the bug (e.g. using [Leaflet plunker](http://leafletjs.com/edit.html)).
 * Check whether the bug can be reproduced in **other browsers**.
 * Check if the bug occurs in the stable version, master, or both.

   friendly.
*  Focus on security and easy auditability/review/rewriting of content.
*  Manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any
   software.
*  Allow module development in any dynamic language, not just Python.

### Overview

After building Presto for the first time, you can load the project into your IDE and run the server. We recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

4. The issue is addressed in a pull request or commit. The issue will be referenced in the commit message so that the code that fixes it is clearly linked.
5. The issue is closed. Sometimes, valid issues will be closed to keep the issue tracker clean. The issue is still indexed and available for future viewers, or can be re-opened if necessary.

Once you're confident that your upcoming changes will be accepted:

* In your forked repository, create a topic branch for your upcoming patch.
  * Usually this is based on the master branch.
  * Checkout a new branch based on master; `git checkout -b my-contrib master`
    Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make focused commits of logical units and describe them properly.
* Avoid re-formatting of the existing code
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* If possible, submit tests along with your topic branch. It will help a lot to get your your patch / new feature accepted, and should prevent unwanted breaking changes to silently happen in future developments.
* Assure nothing is broken by running manual tests, and all the automated tests.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,ufpa,group_5,mitchellh_vagrant.xlsx,11,CONTRIBUTING
"### Submit Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Open a PR to the original repository and choose the right original branch you want to patch (master for most cases).
* If not done in commit messages (which you really should do) please reference and update your issue with the code changes.
* Even if you have write access to the repository, do not directly push or merge your own pull requests. Let another team member review your PR and approve.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,ufpa,group_5,mitchellh_vagrant.xlsx,12,CONTRIBUTING
"### Pull Request Lifecycle

1. You are welcome to submit your PR for commentary or review before it is fully completed. Please prefix the title of your PR with ""[WIP]"" to indicate this. It's also a good idea to include specific questions or items you'd like feedback on.
2. Sign the [HashiCorp CLA](#hashicorp-cla). If you haven't signed the CLA yet, a bot will ask you to do so. You only need to sign the CLA once. If you've already signed the CLA, the CLA status will be green automatically.
3. The PR is categorized by Vagrant collaborator(s), applying GitHub tags similarly to issues triage.
4. Once you believe your PR is ready to be merged, you can remove any
  ""[WIP]"" prefix from the title and a Vagrant collaborator will review.
5. One of the Vagrant collaborators will look over your contribution and either provide comments letting you know if there is anything left to do. We do our best to provide feedback in a timely manner, but it may take some time for us to respond.
6. Once all outstanding comments have been addressed, your contribution will be merged! Merged PRs will be included in the next Vagrant release. The Vagrant contributors will take care of updating the CHANGELOG as they merge.

"What's a Task Queue?
====================

Task queues are used as a mechanism to distribute work across threads or
machines.

A task queue's input is a unit of work, called a task, dedicated worker
processes then constantly monitor the queue for new work to perform.

Celery communicates via messages, usually using a broker
to mediate between clients and workers. To initiate a task a client puts a
message on the queue, the broker then delivers the message to a worker.

A Celery system can consist of multiple workers and brokers, giving way
to high availability and horizontal scaling.

Celery is written in Python, but the protocol can be implemented in any
language. In addition to Python there's node-celery_ for Node.js,
and a `PHP client`_.

Language interoperability can also be achieved by using webhooks
in such a way that the client enqueues an URL to be requested by a worker.

"Community Code of Conduct
=========================

The goal is to maintain a diverse community that's pleasant for everyone.
That's why we would greatly appreciate it if everyone contributing to and
interacting with the community also followed this Code of Conduct.

The Code of Conduct covers our behavior as members of the community,
in any forum, mailing list, wiki, website, Internet relay chat (IRC), public
meeting or private correspondence.

The Code of Conduct is heavily based on the `Ubuntu Code of Conduct`_, and
the `Pylons Code of Conduct`_.

"Be considerate
--------------

Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the
work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and
we expect you to take those consequences into account when making decisions.
Even if it's not obvious at the time, our contributions to Celery will impact
the work of others. For example, changes to code, infrastructure, policy,

others work.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_j,celery_celery.xlsx,6,CONTRIBUTING
"Be respectful
-------------

The Celery community and its members treat one another with respect. Everyone
can make a valuable contribution to Celery. We may not always agree, but
disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all
experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration
to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community
where people feel uncomfortable or threatened isn't a productive one. We
expect members of the Celery community to be respectful when dealing with

users of Celery.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_j,celery_celery.xlsx,7,CONTRIBUTING

----------------

Collaboration is central to Celery and to the larger free software community.
We should always be open to collaboration. Your work should be done
transparently and patches from Celery should be given back to the community
when they're made, not just when the distribution releases. If you wish
to work on new code for existing upstream projects, at least keep those
projects informed of your ideas and progress. It many not be possible to
get consensus from upstream, or even from your colleagues about the correct
implementation for an idea, so don't feel obliged to have that agreement
before you begin, but at least keep the outside world informed of your work,

Disagreements, both political and technical, happen all the time and
the Celery community is no exception. It's important that we resolve
disagreements and differing views constructively and with the help of the

way, then we encourage you to make a derivative distribution or alternate

"Other bugs
----------

Bugs can always be described to the :ref:`mailing-list`, but the best
way to report an issue and to ensure a timely response is to use the
issue tracker.

1) **Create a GitHub account**.

You need to `create a GitHub account`_ to be able to create new issues
and participate in the discussion.

the :ref:`mailing-list`, or :ref:`irc-channel`. If you still need support
you can open a github issue, please prepend the title with ``[QUESTION]``.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_j,celery_celery.xlsx,15,CONTRIBUTING

"4) **Check if you're using the latest version**.

existing report in the bug tracker. Make sure you're using the latest releases of
celery, billiard, kombu, amqp, and vine.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_j,celery_celery.xlsx,17,CONTRIBUTING
"5) **Collect information about the bug**.

To have the best chance of having a bug fixed, we need to be able to easily
reproduce the conditions that caused it. Most of the time this information
will be from a Python traceback message, though some bugs might be in design,
spelling or other errors on the website/docs/code.

    A) If the error is from a Python traceback, include it in the bug report.

    B) We also need to know what platform you're running (Windows, macOS, Linux,
       etc.), the version of your Python interpreter, and the version of Celery,
       and related packages that you were running when the bug occurred.

    C) If you're reporting a race condition or a deadlock, tracebacks can be
       hard to get or might not be that useful. Try to inspect the process to
       get more diagnostic data. Some ideas:

       * Enable Celery's :ref:`breakpoint signal <breakpoint_signal>` and use it
         to inspect the process's state. This will allow you to open a
         :mod:`pdb` session.
       * Collect tracing data using `strace`_(Linux),
         :command:`dtruss` (macOS), and :command:`ktrace` (BSD),
         `ltrace`_, and `lsof`_.

    D) Include the output from the :command:`celery report` command:

        .. code-block:: console

            $ celery -A proj report

        This will also include your configuration settings and it try to
        remove values for keys known to be sensitive, but make sure you also
        verify the information before submitting so that it doesn't contain
        confidential information like API tokens and authentication
        credentials.

    E) You issue might be tagged as `Needs Test Case`. A test case represents
       all the details needed to reproduce what your issue is reporting.
       A test case can be some minimal code that reproduces the issue or
       detailed instructions and configuration values that reproduces
       said issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_j,celery_celery.xlsx,18,CONTRIBUTING

should check back on occasion to ensure you don't miss any questions a
developer trying to fix the bug might ask.

- **Status: Needs Documentation**

  The PR does not contain documentation for the feature or bug fix proposed.

  that reproduces the issue reported. If possible a test case can be submitted in
  the form of a PR to Celery's integration suite. The test case will be marked
  as failed until the bug is fixed. When a test case cannot be run by Celery's

"### Finding Reviewers

As most reviewers are themselves developers with their own projects, the review
process can be quite lengthy, and some amount of patience is required. If you find
that you've been waiting for a pull request to be given attention for several
months, there may be a number of reasons for this, some of which you can do something
about:

  - It may be because of a feature freeze due to an upcoming release. During this time,
    only bug fixes are taken into consideration. If your pull request is a new feature,
    it will not be prioritized until the release is over. Wait for release.
  - It may be because the changes you are suggesting do not appeal to people. Rather than
    nits and critique, which require effort and means they care enough to spend time on your
    contribution, thundering silence is a good sign of widespread (mild) dislike of a given change
    (because people don't assume *others* won't actually like the proposal). Don't take
    that personally, though! Instead, take another critical look at what you are suggesting
    and see if it: changes too much, is too broad, doesn't adhere to the
    [developer notes](doc/developer-notes.md), is dangerous or insecure, is messily written, etc.
    Identify and address any of the issues you find. Then ask e.g. on IRC if someone could give
    their opinion on the concept itself.
  - It may be because your code is too complex for all but a few people. And those people
    may not have realized your pull request even exists. A great way to find people who
    are qualified and care about the code you are touching is the
    [Git Blame feature](https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/). Simply
    find the person touching the code you are touching before you and see if you can find
    them and give them a nudge. Don't be incessant about the nudging though.
  - Finally, if all else fails, ask on IRC or elsewhere for someone to give your pull request
    a look. If you think you've been waiting an unreasonably long amount of time (month+) for
    no particular reason (few lines changed, etc), this is totally fine. Try to return the favor
    when someone else is asking for feedback on their code, and universe balances out.

"Features
--------

* Extensible and feature rich, written in Python. Powerline was 
  completely rewritten in Python to get rid of as much vimscript as 
  possible. This has allowed much better extensibility, leaner and better 
  config files, and a structured, object-oriented codebase with no mandatory
  third-party dependencies other than a Python interpreter.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,ufpa,group_10,powerline_powerline.xlsx,7,README

  of all the project code. The code is tested to work in Python 2.6+ and 
  Python 3.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,ufpa,group_10,powerline_powerline.xlsx,8,README
"* Support for prompts and statuslines in many applications. Originally 
  created exclusively for vim statuslines, the project has evolved to 
  provide statuslines in tmux and several WMs, and prompts for shells like 
  bash/zsh and other applications. It’s simple to write renderers for any 
  other applications that Powerline doesn’t yet support.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,ufpa,group_10,powerline_powerline.xlsx,9,README

"* Fast and lightweight, with daemon support for even better performance.
  Although the code base spans a couple of thousand lines of code with no 
  goal of “less than X lines of code”, the main focus is on good performance 
  and as little code as possible while still providing a rich set of 
  features. The new daemon also ensures that only one Python instance is

"## What is osquery?

osquery exposes an operating system as a high-performance relational database.  This allows you to
write SQL-based queries to explore operating system data.  With osquery, SQL tables represent
abstract concepts such as running processes, loaded kernel modules, open network connections,
browser plugins, hardware events or file hashes.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_r,facebook_osquery.xlsx,4,README
"SQL tables are implemented via a simple plugin and extensions API. A variety of tables already exist
and more are being written: [https://osquery.io/schema](https://osquery.io/schema/). To best
understand the expressiveness that is afforded to you by osquery, consider the following SQL
queries:

"### Setup

1. [Download the installer](https://nodejs.org/) for the LTS version of Node.js. This is the best way to also [install npm](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm#_=_).
2. Fork this repository.
3. Clone your fork.
4. Create a new branch from master for your change.
5. Navigate into the directory of the package you wish to modify (core, angular, etc.).
6. Run `npm install` to install dependencies for this package.
7. Follow the steps for the specific package below.",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,ufpa,group_n,driftyco_ionic.xlsx,12,CONTRIBUTING
"### Core

#### Modifying Components

1. Locate the component(s) to modify inside `/core/src/components/`.
2. Take a look at the [Stencil Documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction/) and other components to understand the implementation of these components.
3. Make your changes to the component. If the change is overly complex or out of the ordinary, add comments so we can understand the changes.
4. [Preview your changes](#preview-changes) locally.
5. [Modify the documentation](#modifying-documentation) if needed.
6. [Run lint](#lint-changes) on the directory and make sure there are no errors.
7. [Build the project](#building-changes).
8. After the build is finished, commit the changes. Please follow the [commit message format](#commit-message-format) for every commit.
9. [Submit a Pull Request](#submit-pull-request) of your changes.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_n,driftyco_ionic.xlsx,13,CONTRIBUTING
"#### Preview Changes

1. Run `npm start` from within the `core` directory.
2. A browser should open at `http://localhost:3333/`.
3. From here, navigate to one of the component's tests to preview your changes.
4. If a test showing your change doesn't exist, [add a new test or update an existing one](#modifying-tests).
5. To test in RTL mode, once you are in the desired component's test, add `?rtl=true` at the end of the url; for example: `http://localhost:3333/src/components/alert/test/basic?rtl=true`.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_n,driftyco_ionic.xlsx,14,CONTRIBUTING
"#### Lint Changes

1. Run `npm run lint` to lint the TypeScript and Sass.
2. If there are lint errors, run `npm run lint.fix` to automatically fix any errors. Repeat step 1 to ensure the errors have been fixed, and manually fix them if not.
3. To lint and fix only TypeScript errors, run `npm run lint.ts` and `npm run lint.ts.fix`, respectively.
4. To lint and fix only Sass errors, run `npm run lint.sass` and `npm run lint.sass.fix`, respectively.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_n,driftyco_ionic.xlsx,15,CONTRIBUTING
"#### Modifying Documentation

1. Locate the `readme.md` file in the component's directory.
2. Modify the documentation **above** the line that says `<!-- Auto Generated Below -->` in this file.
3. To update any of the auto generated documentation below that line, make the relevant changes in the following places:
  - `Usage`: update the component's usage examples in the component's `usage/` directory
  - `Properties`, `Events`, or `Methods`: update the component's TypeScript file (`*.tsx`)
  - `CSS Custom Properties`: update the component's main Sass file (`*.scss`)",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_n,driftyco_ionic.xlsx,16,CONTRIBUTING
"#### Modifying Tests

1. Locate the test to modify inside the `test/` folder in the component's directory.
2. If a test exists, modify the test by adding an example to reproduce the problem fixed or feature added.
3. If a new test is needed, the easiest way is to copy the `basic/` directory from the component's `test/` directory, rename it, and edit the content in both the `index.html` and `e2e.ts` file (see [Screenshot Tests](#screenshot-tests) for more information on this file).
4. The `preview/` directory is used in the documentation as a demo. Only update this test if there is a bug in the test or if the API has a change that hasn't been updated in the test.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_n,driftyco_ionic.xlsx,17,CONTRIBUTING
"##### Screenshot Tests

1. If the test exists in screenshot, there will be a file named `e2e.ts` in the directory of the test.
2. A screenshot test can be added by including this file and adding one or more `test()` calls that include a call to `page.compareScreenshot()`. See [Stencil end-to-end testing](https://stenciljs.com/docs/end-to-end-testing) and existing tests in `core/` for examples.
3. **Important:** each `test()` should have only one screenshot (`page.compareScreenshot()`) call **or** it should check the expect at the end of each test. If there is a mismatch it will fail the test which will prevent the rest of the test from running, i.e. if the first screenshot fails the remaining screenshot calls would not be called _unless_ they are in a separate test or all of the expects are called at the end.
4. To run screenshot locally, use the following command: `npm run test.screenshot`.
    - To run screenshot for a specific test, pass the path to the test or a string to search for.
    - For example, running all `alert` tests: `npm run test.screenshot alert`.
    - Or, running the basic `alert` tests: `npm run test.screenshot src/components/alert/test/basic/e2e.ts`.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_n,driftyco_ionic.xlsx,18,CONTRIBUTING
"#### Building Changes

1. Once all changes have been made and the documentation has been updated, run `npm run build` inside of the `core` directory. This will add your changes to any auto-generated files, if necessary.
2. Review the changes and, if everything looks correct, [commit](#commit-message-format) the changes.
3. Make sure the build has finished before committing. If you made changes to the documentation, properties, methods, or anything else that requires an update to a generate file, this needs to be committed.
4. After the changes have been pushed, publish the branch and [create a pull request](#creating-a-pull-request).",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_n,driftyco_ionic.xlsx,19,CONTRIBUTING
"### Submit Pull Request

1. [Create a new pull request](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/compare) with the `master` branch as the `base`. You may need to click on `compare across forks` to find your changes.
2. See the [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) GitHub help article for more information.
3. Please fill out the provided Pull Request template to the best of your ability and include any issues that are related.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,ufpa,group_n,driftyco_ionic.xlsx,20,CONTRIBUTING

"#### Scope
The scope can be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `action-sheet`, `button`, `menu`, `nav`, etc. If you make multiple commits for the same component, please keep the naming of this component consistent.

"#### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: ""change"" not ""changed"" nor ""changes""
* do not capitalize first letter
* do not place a period `.` at the end
* entire length of the commit message must not go over 50 characters
* describe what the commit does, not what issue it relates to or fixes
* **be brief, yet descriptive** - we should have a good understanding of what the commit does by reading the subject",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_n,driftyco_ionic.xlsx,24,CONTRIBUTING

This code creates a scene, a camera, and a geometric cube, and it adds the cube to the scene. It then creates a `WebGL` renderer for the scene and camera, and it adds that viewport to the document.body element. Finally, it animates the cube within the scene for the camera.

```javascript
var camera, scene, renderer;
var geometry, material, mesh;

init();
animate();

function init() {

	camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 70, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.01, 10 );
	camera.position.z = 1;

	scene = new THREE.Scene();

	geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 );
	material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial();

	mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
	scene.add( mesh );

	renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer( { antialias: true } );
	renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
	document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

}

For testing you can use the *test* `rake` tasks and the `bin/rspec` command, see instructions below:",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_p,elasticsearch_logstash.xlsx,26,README
"### Core tests

1- To run the core tests you can use the Gradle task:

    ./gradlew test

  or use the `rspec` tool to run all tests or run a specific test:

    bin/rspec
    bin/rspec spec/foo/bar_spec.rb

  Note that before running the `rspec` command for the first time you need to set up the RSpec test dependencies by running:

    ./gradlew bootstrap

"Sometimes you might find a change to a piece of Logstash code causes a test to hang. These can be hard to debug.

If you set `LS_JAVA_OPTS=""-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005""` you can connect to a running Logstash with your IDEs debugger which can be a great way of finding the issue.

"### Plugins tests

To run the tests of all currently installed plugins:

    rake test:plugin

You can install the default set of plugins included in the logstash package:

    rake test:install-default

---
Note that if a plugin is installed using the plugin manager `bin/logstash-plugin install ...` do not forget to also install the plugins development dependencies using the following command after the plugin installation:

Built artifacts will be placed in the `LS_HOME/build` directory, and will create the directory if it is not already present.

You can build a Logstash snapshot package as tarball or zip file

```sh
./gradlew assembleTarDistribution

According to [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/):

> A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.

Each logstash plugin contains a CHANGELOG.md markdown file. Here's an example: https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ufpa,group_p,elasticsearch_logstash.xlsx,15,CONTRIBUTING

"#### When should I add an entry to the CHANGELOG.md?

Update the changelog before you push a new release to rubygems.org.

To prevent merged pull requests from sitting in the master branch until someone decides to cut a release,
we strive to publish a new version for each pull request. (This is not mandatory. See below.)
You are therefore encouraged to bump the gemspec version and add a changelog entry in the same pull request as the change.

## Unreleased
  - Removed `sleep(0.0001)` from inner loop that was making things a bit slower [#133](http://example.org)

1. be a summary of the Pull Request and contain a markdown link to it.
2. start with [BREAKING], when it denotes a breaking change.

* Install dependencies: `composer install`.
* Create a new branch, e.g. `feature-foo` or `bugfix-bar`.
* Make changes.

"### Finding Reviewers

As most reviewers are themselves developers with their own projects, the review
process can be quite lengthy, and some amount of patience is required. If you find
that you've been waiting for a pull request to be given attention for several
months, there may be a number of reasons for this, some of which you can do something
about:

  - It may be because of a feature freeze due to an upcoming release. During this time,
    only bug fixes are taken into consideration. If your pull request is a new feature,
    it will not be prioritized until the release is over. Wait for release.
  - It may be because the changes you are suggesting do not appeal to people. Rather than
    nits and critique, which require effort and means they care enough to spend time on your
    contribution, thundering silence is a good sign of widespread (mild) dislike of a given change
    (because people don't assume *others* won't actually like the proposal). Don't take
    that personally, though! Instead, take another critical look at what you are suggesting
    and see if it: changes too much, is too broad, doesn't adhere to the
    [developer notes](doc/developer-notes.md), is dangerous or insecure, is messily written, etc.
    Identify and address any of the issues you find. Then ask e.g. on IRC if someone could give
    their opinion on the concept itself.
  - It may be because your code is too complex for all but a few people. And those people
    may not have realized your pull request even exists. A great way to find people who
    are qualified and care about the code you are touching is the
    [Git Blame feature](https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/). Simply
    find the person touching the code you are touching before you and see if you can find
    them and give them a nudge. Don't be incessant about the nudging though.
  - Finally, if all else fails, ask on IRC or elsewhere for someone to give your pull request
    a look. If you think you've been waiting an unreasonably long amount of time (month+) for
    no particular reason (few lines changed, etc), this is totally fine. Try to return the favor
    when someone else is asking for feedback on their code, and universe balances out.

"#### What's a CHANGELOG file?

According to [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/):

> A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.

Each logstash plugin contains a CHANGELOG.md markdown file. Here's an example: https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_g,elasticsearch_logstash.xlsx,15,CONTRIBUTING

"#### When should I add an entry to the CHANGELOG.md?

Update the changelog before you push a new release to rubygems.org.

To prevent merged pull requests from sitting in the master branch until someone decides to cut a release,
we strive to publish a new version for each pull request. (This is not mandatory. See below.)
You are therefore encouraged to bump the gemspec version and add a changelog entry in the same pull request as the change. See [logstash-input-snmp#8](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-snmp/pull/8/files) as an example.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,usp,student_g,elasticsearch_logstash.xlsx,17,CONTRIBUTING
"If have no intentions to release the change immediately after merging the pull request
then you should still create an entry in the changelog, using the word `Unreleased` as the version. Example:

```markdown
## Unreleased
  - Removed `sleep(0.0001)` from inner loop that was making things a bit slower [#133](http://example.org)

## 3.3.3
  - Fix when no delimiter is found in a chunk, the chunk is reread - no forward progress

"#### What is the format of the Changelog entries?

Most code in logstash-plugins comes from self-contained changes in the form of pull requests, so each entry should:

1. be a summary of the Pull Request and contain a markdown link to it.
2. start with [BREAKING], when it denotes a breaking change.
  * Note: Breaking changes should warrant a major version bump.
3. after [BREAKING], start with one of the following keywords:
    `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`.

contributions to core should abide by the following osquery guiding principles in order to be
accepted:

1. osquery doesn’t change the state of the system
2. osquery doesn’t create network traffic to third parties
3. osquery’s endpoint binaries have a light memory footprint

"## Running Presto in your IDE

### Overview

After building Presto for the first time, you can load the project into your IDE and run the server. We recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Because Presto is a standard Maven project, you can import it into your IDE using the root `pom.xml` file. In IntelliJ, choose Open Project from the Quick Start box or choose Open from the File menu and select the root `pom.xml` file.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_g,facebook_presto.xlsx,6,README
"After opening the project in IntelliJ, double check that the Java SDK is properly configured for the project:

* Open the File menu and select Project Structure
* In the SDKs section, ensure that a 1.8 JDK is selected (create one if none exist)
* In the Project section, ensure the Project language level is set to 8.0 as Presto makes use of several Java 8 language features",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_g,facebook_presto.xlsx,7,README

"The working directory should be the `presto-main` subdirectory. In IntelliJ, using `$MODULE_DIR$` accomplishes this automatically.

"### Using SOCKS for Hive or HDFS

If your Hive metastore or HDFS cluster is not directly accessible to your local machine, you can use SSH port forwarding to access it. Setup a dynamic SOCKS proxy with SSH listening on local port 1080:

request. Typically reviewers will review the code for obvious errors, as well as
test out the patch set and opine on the technical merits of the patch. Project
maintainers take into account the peer review when determining if there is
consensus to merge a pull request (remember that discussions may have been
spread out over GitHub, mailing list and IRC discussions).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_a,bitcoin_bitcoin.xlsx,40,CONTRIBUTING
"The following
language is used within pull-request comments:

  - (t)ACK means ""I have tested the code and I agree it should be merged"", involving
    change-specific manual testing in addition to running the unit and functional
    tests, and in case it is not obvious how the manual testing was done, it should
    be described;
  - NACK means ""I disagree this should be merged"", and must be accompanied by
    sound technical justification (or in certain cases of copyright/patent/licensing
    issues, legal justification). NACKs without accompanying reasoning may be
    disregarded;
  - utACK means ""I have not tested the code, but I have reviewed it and it looks
    OK, I agree it can be merged"";
  - Concept ACK means ""I agree in the general principle of this pull request"";
  - Nit refers to trivial, often non-blocking issues.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_a,bitcoin_bitcoin.xlsx,41,CONTRIBUTING

"Project maintainers reserve the right to weigh the opinions of peer reviewers

"### Finding Reviewers

As most reviewers are themselves developers with their own projects, the review
process can be quite lengthy, and some amount of patience is required. If you find
that you've been waiting for a pull request to be given attention for several
months, there may be a number of reasons for this, some of which you can do something
about:

  - It may be because of a feature freeze due to an upcoming release. During this time,
    only bug fixes are taken into consideration. If your pull request is a new feature,
    it will not be prioritized until the release is over. Wait for release.
  - It may be because the changes you are suggesting do not appeal to people. Rather than
    nits and critique, which require effort and means they care enough to spend time on your
    contribution, thundering silence is a good sign of widespread (mild) dislike of a given change
    (because people don't assume *others* won't actually like the proposal). Don't take
    that personally, though! Instead, take another critical look at what you are suggesting
    and see if it: changes too much, is too broad, doesn't adhere to the
    [developer notes](doc/developer-notes.md), is dangerous or insecure, is messily written, etc.
    Identify and address any of the issues you find. Then ask e.g. on IRC if someone could give
    their opinion on the concept itself.
  - It may be because your code is too complex for all but a few people. And those people
    may not have realized your pull request even exists. A great way to find people who
    are qualified and care about the code you are touching is the
    [Git Blame feature](https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/). Simply
    find the person touching the code you are touching before you and see if you can find
    them and give them a nudge. Don't be incessant about the nudging though.
  - Finally, if all else fails, ask on IRC or elsewhere for someone to give your pull request
    a look. If you think you've been waiting an unreasonably long amount of time (month+) for
    no particular reason (few lines changed, etc), this is totally fine. Try to return the favor
    when someone else is asking for feedback on their code, and universe balances out.

You can configure youtube-dl by placing any supported command line option to a configuration file.

"For example, with the following configuration file youtube-dl will always extract the audio, not copy the mtime, use a proxy and save all videos under `Movies` directory in your home directory:

### Authentication with `.netrc` file

You may also want to configure automatic credentials storage for extractors that support authentication (by providing login and password with `--username` and `--password`) in order not to pass credentials as command line arguments on every youtube-dl execution and prevent tracking plain text passwords in the shell command history. You can achieve this using a [`.netrc` file](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/.netrc/info) on a per extractor basis. For that you will need to create a `.netrc` file in your `$HOME` and restrict permissions to read/write by only you:",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,25,README
"```
touch $HOME/.netrc
chmod a-rwx,u+rw $HOME/.netrc

After that you can add credentials for an extractor in the following format, where *extractor* is the name of the extractor in lowercase:
```
machine <extractor> login <login> password <password>

machine youtube login myaccount@gmail.com password my_youtube_password
machine twitch login my_twitch_account_name password my_twitch_password

"# FORMAT SELECTION

By default youtube-dl tries to download the best available quality, i.e. if you want the best quality you **don't need** to pass any special options, youtube-dl will guess it for you by **default**.

But sometimes you may want to download in a different format, for example when you are on a slow or intermittent connection. The key mechanism for achieving this is so-called *format selection* based on which you can explicitly specify desired format, select formats based on some criterion or criteria, setup precedence and much more.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,39,README
"The general syntax for format selection is `--format FORMAT` or shorter `-f FORMAT` where `FORMAT` is a *selector expression*, i.e. an expression that describes format or formats you would like to download.

**tl;dr:** [navigate me to examples](#format-selection-examples).

The simplest case is requesting a specific format, for example with `-f 22` you can download the format with format code equal to 22. You can get the list of available format codes for particular video using `--list-formats` or `-F`. Note that these format codes are extractor specific.

 - `bestvideo`: Select the best quality video-only format (e.g. DASH video). May not be available.
 - `worstvideo`: Select the worst quality video-only format. May not be available.

"For example, to download the worst quality video-only format you can use `-f worstvideo`.

If you want to download multiple videos and they don't have the same formats available, you can specify the order of preference using slashes. Note that slash is left-associative, i.e. formats on the left hand side are preferred, for example `-f 22/17/18` will download format 22 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 17 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 18 if it's available, otherwise it will complain that no suitable formats are available for download.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,43,README

"## youtube-dl coding conventions

This section introduces a guide lines for writing idiomatic, robust and future-proof extractor code.

Extractors are very fragile by nature since they depend on the layout of the source data provided by 3rd party media hosters out of your control and this layout tends to change. As an extractor implementer your task is not only to write code that will extract media links and metadata correctly but also to minimize dependency on the source's layout and even to make the code foresee potential future changes and be ready for that.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,121,README
"This is important because it will allow the extractor not to break on minor layout changes thus keeping old youtube-dl versions working. Even though this breakage issue is easily fixed by emitting a new version of youtube-dl with a fix incorporated, all the previous versions become broken in all repositories and distros' packages that may not be so prompt in fetching the update from us. Needless to say, some non rolling release distros may never receive an update at all.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,122,README
"### Mandatory and optional metafields

For extraction to work youtube-dl relies on metadata your extractor extracts and provides to youtube-dl expressed by an [information dictionary](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/7f41a598b3fba1bcab2817de64a08941200aa3c8/youtube_dl/extractor/common.py#L94-L303) or simply *info dict*.

 - `title` (media title)
 - `url` (media download URL) or `formats`",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,123,README
In fact only the last option is technically mandatory (i.e. if you can't figure out the download location of the media the extraction does not make any sense). But by convention youtube-dl also treats `id` and `title` as mandatory. Thus the aforementioned metafields are the critical data that the extraction does not make any sense without and if any of them fail to be extracted then the extractor is considered completely broken.,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,124,README

That means that extraction should be **tolerant** to situations when sources for these fields can potentially be unavailable (even if they are always available at the moment) and **future-proof** in order not to break the extraction of general purpose mandatory fields.,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,125,README

Say you have some source dictionary `meta` that you've fetched as JSON with HTTP request and it has a key `summary`:

"Assume you want to extract `summary` and put it into the resulting info dict as `description`. Since `description` is an optional meta field you should be ready that this key may be missing from the `meta` dict, so that you should extract it like:

Similarly, you should pass `fatal=False` when extracting optional data from a webpage with `_search_regex`, `_html_search_regex` or similar methods, for instance:

When extracting metadata try to do so from multiple sources. For example if `title` is present in several places, try extracting from at least some of them. This makes it more future-proof in case some of the sources become unavailable.

"# EMBEDDING YOUTUBE-DL

youtube-dl makes the best effort to be a good command-line program, and thus should be callable from any programming language. If you encounter any problems parsing its output, feel free to [create a report](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/new).

From a Python program, you can embed youtube-dl in a more powerful fashion, like this:

```python
from __future__ import unicode_literals
import youtube_dl

ydl_opts = {}
with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
    ydl.download(['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc'])
```",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,144,README
"Most likely, you'll want to use various options. For a list of options available, have a look at [`youtube_dl/YoutubeDL.py`](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/3e4cedf9e8cd3157df2457df7274d0c842421945/youtube_dl/YoutubeDL.py#L137-L312). For a start, if you want to intercept youtube-dl's output, set a `logger` object.

Here's a more complete example of a program that outputs only errors (and a short message after the download is finished), and downloads/converts the video to an mp3 file:

```python
from __future__ import unicode_literals
import youtube_dl


class MyLogger(object):
    def debug(self, msg):
        pass

    def warning(self, msg):
        pass

    def error(self, msg):
        print(msg)


def my_hook(d):
    if d['status'] == 'finished':
        print('Done downloading, now converting ...')


ydl_opts = {
    'format': 'bestaudio/best',
    'postprocessors': [{
        'key': 'FFmpegExtractAudio',
        'preferredcodec': 'mp3',
        'preferredquality': '192',
    }],
    'logger': MyLogger(),
    'progress_hooks': [my_hook],
}

        git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/youtube-dl.git

3. Start a new git branch with

        cd youtube-dl
        git checkout -b yourextractor

6. Run `python test/test_download.py TestDownload.test_YourExtractor`. This *should fail* at first, but you can continually re-run it until you're done. If you decide to add more than one test, then rename ``_TEST`` to ``_TESTS`` and make it into a list of dictionaries.

"## youtube-dl coding conventions

This section introduces a guide lines for writing idiomatic, robust and future-proof extractor code.

Extractors are very fragile by nature since they depend on the layout of the source data provided by 3rd party media hosters out of your control and this layout tends to change. As an extractor implementer your task is not only to write code that will extract media links and metadata correctly but also to minimize dependency on the source's layout and even to make the code foresee potential future changes and be ready for that. This is important because it will allow the extractor not to break on minor layout changes thus keeping old youtube-dl versions working. Even though this breakage issue is easily fixed by emitting a new version of youtube-dl with a fix incorporated, all the previous versions become broken in all repositories and distros' packages that may not be so prompt in fetching the update from us. Needless to say, some non rolling release distros may never receive an update at all.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,26,CONTRIBUTING
"### Mandatory and optional metafields

For extraction to work youtube-dl relies on metadata your extractor extracts and provides to youtube-dl expressed by an [information dictionary](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/7f41a598b3fba1bcab2817de64a08941200aa3c8/youtube_dl/extractor/common.py#L94-L303) or simply *info dict*. Only the following meta fields in the *info dict* are considered mandatory for a successful extraction process by youtube-dl:

 - `id` (media identifier)
 - `title` (media title)
 - `url` (media download URL) or `formats`",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,27,CONTRIBUTING
In fact only the last option is technically mandatory (i.e. if you can't figure out the download location of the media the extraction does not make any sense). But by convention youtube-dl also treats `id` and `title` as mandatory. Thus the aforementioned metafields are the critical data that the extraction does not make any sense without and if any of them fail to be extracted then the extractor is considered completely broken.,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,28,CONTRIBUTING
[Any field](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/7f41a598b3fba1bcab2817de64a08941200aa3c8/youtube_dl/extractor/common.py#L188-L303) apart from the aforementioned ones are considered **optional**. That means that extraction should be **tolerant** to situations when sources for these fields can potentially be unavailable (even if they are always available at the moment) and **future-proof** in order not to break the extraction of general purpose mandatory fields.,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,29,CONTRIBUTING
"#### Example

Say you have some source dictionary `meta` that you've fetched as JSON with HTTP request and it has a key `summary`:

```python
meta = self._download_json(url, video_id)
```",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,30,CONTRIBUTING
"Assume at this point `meta`'s layout is:

    ""summary"": ""some fancy summary text"",
    ...
}
```",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,31,CONTRIBUTING
"Assume you want to extract `summary` and put it into the resulting info dict as `description`. Since `description` is an optional meta field you should be ready that this key may be missing from the `meta` dict, so that you should extract it like:

```python
description = meta.get('summary')  # correct
```

and not like:

```python
description = meta['summary']  # incorrect
```",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,32,CONTRIBUTING
The latter will break extraction process with `KeyError` if `summary` disappears from `meta` at some later time but with the former approach extraction will just go ahead with `description` set to `None` which is perfectly fine (remember `None` is equivalent to the absence of data).,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,33,CONTRIBUTING
"Similarly, you should pass `fatal=False` when extracting optional data from a webpage with `_search_regex`, `_html_search_regex` or similar methods, for instance:

```python
description = self._search_regex(
    r'<span[^>]+id=""title""[^>]*>([^<]+)<',
    webpage, 'description', fatal=False)
```",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,34,CONTRIBUTING
"With `fatal` set to `False` if `_search_regex` fails to extract `description` it will emit a warning and continue extraction.

You can also pass `default=<some fallback value>`, for example:

```python
description = self._search_regex(
    r'<span[^>]+id=""title""[^>]*>([^<]+)<',
    webpage, 'description', default=None)
```",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,35,CONTRIBUTING
On failure this code will silently continue the extraction with `description` set to `None`. That is useful for metafields that may or may not be present.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,36,CONTRIBUTING
"### Provide fallbacks

When extracting metadata try to do so from multiple sources. For example if `title` is present in several places, try extracting from at least some of them. This makes it more future-proof in case some of the sources become unavailable.

#### Example

Say `meta` from the previous example has a `title` and you are about to extract it. Since `title` is a mandatory meta field you should end up with something like:

```python
title = meta['title']
```",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,37,CONTRIBUTING
"If `title` disappears from `meta` in future due to some changes on the hoster's side the extraction would fail since `title` is mandatory. That's expected.

Assume that you have some another source you can extract `title` from, for example `og:title` HTML meta of a `webpage`. In this case you can provide a fallback scenario:

```python
title = meta.get('title') or self._og_search_title(webpage)
```",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_h,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,38,CONTRIBUTING

**pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data
structures designed to make working with ""relational"" or ""labeled"" data both
easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for
doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has
the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data

"### Core

#### Modifying Components

1. Locate the component(s) to modify inside `/core/src/components/`.
2. Take a look at the [Stencil Documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction/) and other components to understand the implementation of these components.
3. Make your changes to the component. If the change is overly complex or out of the ordinary, add comments so we can understand the changes.
4. [Preview your changes](#preview-changes) locally.
5. [Modify the documentation](#modifying-documentation) if needed.
6. [Run lint](#lint-changes) on the directory and make sure there are no errors.
7. [Build the project](#building-changes).
8. After the build is finished, commit the changes. Please follow the [commit message format](#commit-message-format) for every commit.

"#### Preview Changes

1. Run `npm start` from within the `core` directory.
2. A browser should open at `http://localhost:3333/`.
3. From here, navigate to one of the component's tests to preview your changes.
4. If a test showing your change doesn't exist, [add a new test or update an existing one](#modifying-tests).

2. If there are lint errors, run `npm run lint.fix` to automatically fix any errors. Repeat step 1 to ensure the errors have been fixed, and manually fix them if not.
3. To lint and fix only TypeScript errors, run `npm run lint.ts` and `npm run lint.ts.fix`, respectively.

"#### Modifying Documentation

1. Locate the `readme.md` file in the component's directory.
2. Modify the documentation **above** the line that says `<!-- Auto Generated Below -->` in this file.
3. To update any of the auto generated documentation below that line, make the relevant changes in the following places:
  - `Usage`: update the component's usage examples in the component's `usage/` directory
  - `Properties`, `Events`, or `Methods`: update the component's TypeScript file (`*.tsx`)

1. Locate the test to modify inside the `test/` folder in the component's directory.
2. If a test exists, modify the test by adding an example to reproduce the problem fixed or feature added.
3. If a new test is needed, the easiest way is to copy the `basic/` directory from the component's `test/` directory, rename it, and edit the content in both the `index.html` and `e2e.ts` file (see [Screenshot Tests](#screenshot-tests) for more information on this file).

"##### Screenshot Tests

1. If the test exists in screenshot, there will be a file named `e2e.ts` in the directory of the test.
2. A screenshot test can be added by including this file and adding one or more `test()` calls that include a call to `page.compareScreenshot()`. See [Stencil end-to-end testing](https://stenciljs.com/docs/end-to-end-testing) and existing tests in `core/` for examples.
3. **Important:** each `test()` should have only one screenshot (`page.compareScreenshot()`) call **or** it should check the expect at the end of each test. If there is a mismatch it will fail the test which will prevent the rest of the test from running, i.e. if the first screenshot fails the remaining screenshot calls would not be called _unless_ they are in a separate test or all of the expects are called at the end.
4. To run screenshot locally, use the following command: `npm run test.screenshot`.
    - To run screenshot for a specific test, pass the path to the test or a string to search for.
    - For example, running all `alert` tests: `npm run test.screenshot alert`.
    - Or, running the basic `alert` tests: `npm run test.screenshot src/components/alert/test/basic/e2e.ts`.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_e,driftyco_ionic.xlsx,18,CONTRIBUTING
"#### Building Changes

1. Once all changes have been made and the documentation has been updated, run `npm run build` inside of the `core` directory. This will add your changes to any auto-generated files, if necessary.
2. Review the changes and, if everything looks correct, [commit](#commit-message-format) the changes.
3. Make sure the build has finished before committing. If you made changes to the documentation, properties, methods, or anything else that requires an update to a generate file, this needs to be committed.

I started using Vagrant and Puppet when I wanted a simple PHP 5.4 VM to do my development on. I could find nothing
pre-made that didn't come with a bunch of cruft I did not want so I decided to create a tool that would ease this
task for other developers who may not want to learn Puppet's DSL to get a VM up and running so they can develop
in their language of choice.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_d,puphet-puphet.xlsx,6,README

* Create a branch based on master; `git branch
fix/master/my_contribution master` then checkout the new branch with `git
checkout fix/master/my_contribution`. Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units and describe them properly.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* If possible, submit tests to your patch/new feature so it can be tested easily.
* Assure nothing is broken by running all the tests.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,usp,student_d,puphet-puphet.xlsx,4,CONTRIBUTING

"What's a Task Queue?
====================

Task queues are used as a mechanism to distribute work across threads or
machines.

A task queue's input is a unit of work, called a task, dedicated worker
processes then constantly monitor the queue for new work to perform.

Celery communicates via messages, usually using a broker
to mediate between clients and workers. To initiate a task a client puts a
message on the queue, the broker then delivers the message to a worker.

A Celery system can consist of multiple workers and brokers, giving way
to high availability and horizontal scaling.

Celery is written in Python, but the protocol can be implemented in any
language. In addition to Python there's node-celery_ for Node.js,
and a `PHP client`_.

Language interoperability can also be achieved by using webhooks
in such a way that the client enqueues an URL to be requested by a worker.

below to ensure that your bug report contains enough information

"Community Code of Conduct
=========================

The goal is to maintain a diverse community that's pleasant for everyone.

interacting with the community also followed this Code of Conduct.

The Code of Conduct covers our behavior as members of the community,
in any forum, mailing list, wiki, website, Internet relay chat (IRC), public
meeting or private correspondence.

The Code of Conduct is heavily based on the `Ubuntu Code of Conduct`_, and
the `Pylons Code of Conduct`_.

"Be considerate
--------------

Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the
work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and
we expect you to take those consequences into account when making decisions.
Even if it's not obvious at the time, our contributions to Celery will impact
the work of others. For example, changes to code, infrastructure, policy,
documentation and translations during a release may negatively impact
others work.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_n,celery_celery.xlsx,6,CONTRIBUTING
"Be respectful
-------------

The Celery community and its members treat one another with respect. Everyone
can make a valuable contribution to Celery. We may not always agree, but
disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all
experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration
to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community
where people feel uncomfortable or threatened isn't a productive one. We
expect members of the Celery community to be respectful when dealing with
other contributors as well as with people outside the Celery project and with
users of Celery.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_n,celery_celery.xlsx,7,CONTRIBUTING
"Be collaborative
----------------

Collaboration is central to Celery and to the larger free software community.
We should always be open to collaboration. Your work should be done
transparently and patches from Celery should be given back to the community
when they're made, not just when the distribution releases. If you wish
to work on new code for existing upstream projects, at least keep those
projects informed of your ideas and progress. It many not be possible to
get consensus from upstream, or even from your colleagues about the correct
implementation for an idea, so don't feel obliged to have that agreement
before you begin, but at least keep the outside world informed of your work,
and publish your work in a way that allows outsiders to test, discuss, and
contribute to your efforts.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_n,celery_celery.xlsx,8,CONTRIBUTING
"When you disagree, consult others
---------------------------------

Disagreements, both political and technical, happen all the time and
the Celery community is no exception. It's important that we resolve
disagreements and differing views constructively and with the help of the
community and community process. If you really want to go a different
way, then we encourage you to make a derivative distribution or alternate
set of packages that still build on the work we've done to utilize as common
of a core as possible.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_n,celery_celery.xlsx,9,CONTRIBUTING
"When you're unsure, ask for help
--------------------------------

Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect. Asking
questions avoids many problems down the road, and so questions are
encouraged. Those who are asked questions should be responsive and helpful.

forum.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_n,celery_celery.xlsx,10,CONTRIBUTING

-----------------------

Developers on every project come and go and Celery is no different. When you

so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should
tell people you're leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others

"Other bugs
----------

Bugs can always be described to the :ref:`mailing-list`, but the best
way to report an issue and to ensure a timely response is to use the
issue tracker.

1) **Create a GitHub account**.

You need to `create a GitHub account`_ to be able to create new issues
and participate in the discussion.

"2) **Determine if your bug is really a bug**.

You shouldn't file a bug if you're requesting support. For that you can use
the :ref:`mailing-list`, or :ref:`irc-channel`. If you still need support
you can open a github issue, please prepend the title with ``[QUESTION]``.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_n,celery_celery.xlsx,15,CONTRIBUTING

check if you have new information that could be reported to help
the developers fix the bug.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_n,celery_celery.xlsx,16,CONTRIBUTING
"4) **Check if you're using the latest version**.

A bug could be fixed by some other improvements and fixes - it might not have an
existing report in the bug tracker. Make sure you're using the latest releases of
celery, billiard, kombu, amqp, and vine.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_n,celery_celery.xlsx,17,CONTRIBUTING
"5) **Collect information about the bug**.

To have the best chance of having a bug fixed, we need to be able to easily
reproduce the conditions that caused it. Most of the time this information
will be from a Python traceback message, though some bugs might be in design,
spelling or other errors on the website/docs/code.

    A) If the error is from a Python traceback, include it in the bug report.

    B) We also need to know what platform you're running (Windows, macOS, Linux,
       etc.), the version of your Python interpreter, and the version of Celery,
       and related packages that you were running when the bug occurred.

    C) If you're reporting a race condition or a deadlock, tracebacks can be
       hard to get or might not be that useful. Try to inspect the process to
       get more diagnostic data. Some ideas:

       * Enable Celery's :ref:`breakpoint signal <breakpoint_signal>` and use it
         to inspect the process's state. This will allow you to open a
         :mod:`pdb` session.
       * Collect tracing data using `strace`_(Linux),
         :command:`dtruss` (macOS), and :command:`ktrace` (BSD),
         `ltrace`_, and `lsof`_.

    D) Include the output from the :command:`celery report` command:

        .. code-block:: console

            $ celery -A proj report

        This will also include your configuration settings and it try to
        remove values for keys known to be sensitive, but make sure you also
        verify the information before submitting so that it doesn't contain
        confidential information like API tokens and authentication
        credentials.

    E) You issue might be tagged as `Needs Test Case`. A test case represents
       all the details needed to reproduce what your issue is reporting.
       A test case can be some minimal code that reproduces the issue or
       detailed instructions and configuration values that reproduces
       said issue.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_n,celery_celery.xlsx,18,CONTRIBUTING
"6) **Submit the bug**.

By default `GitHub`_ will email you to let you know when new comments have
been made on your bug. In the event you've turned this feature off, you
should check back on occasion to ensure you don't miss any questions a
developer trying to fix the bug might ask.

Release Procedure
=================

Updating the version number
---------------------------

The version number must be updated three places:

    * :file:`celery/__init__.py`
    * :file:`docs/include/introduction.txt`
    * :file:`README.rst`

The changes to the previous files can be handled with the [`bumpversion` command line tool]
(https://pypi.org/project/bumpversion/). The corresponding configuration lives in
:file:`.bumpversion.cfg`. To do the necessary changes run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ bumpversion",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_n,celery_celery.xlsx,86,CONTRIBUTING
"After you have changed these files you must render
the :file:`README` files. There's a script to convert sphinx syntax
to generic reStructured Text syntax, and the make target `readme`
does this for you:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make readme

Now commit the changes:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git commit -a -m ""Bumps version to X.Y.Z""

and make a new version tag:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git tag vX.Y.Z
    $ git push --tags",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,usp,student_n,celery_celery.xlsx,87,CONTRIBUTING
"Releasing
---------

Commands to make a new public stable release:

=================

*  Have a dead simple setup process and a minimal learning curve.
*  Manage machines very quickly and in parallel.
*  Avoid custom-agents and additional open ports, be agentless by
   leveraging the existing SSH daemon.
*  Describe infrastructure in a language that is both machine and human
   friendly.
*  Focus on security and easy auditability/review/rewriting of content.
*  Manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any
   software.
*  Allow module development in any dynamic language, not just Python.
*  Be usable as non-root.

> A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.

Each logstash plugin contains a CHANGELOG.md markdown file. Here's an example: https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_n,elasticsearch_logstash.xlsx,15,CONTRIBUTING

"#### When should I add an entry to the CHANGELOG.md?

Update the changelog before you push a new release to rubygems.org.

To prevent merged pull requests from sitting in the master branch until someone decides to cut a release,
we strive to publish a new version for each pull request. (This is not mandatory. See below.)
You are therefore encouraged to bump the gemspec version and add a changelog entry in the same pull request as the change.

## Unreleased
  - Removed `sleep(0.0001)` from inner loop that was making things a bit slower [#133](http://example.org)

1. be a summary of the Pull Request and contain a markdown link to it.
2. start with [BREAKING], when it denotes a breaking change.

easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for
doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has
the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data
analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on
its way towards this goal.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_n,pydata_pandas.xlsx,4,README

"What's a Task Queue?
====================

Task queues are used as a mechanism to distribute work across threads or
machines.

A task queue's input is a unit of work, called a task, dedicated worker
processes then constantly monitor the queue for new work to perform.

Celery communicates via messages, usually using a broker
to mediate between clients and workers. To initiate a task a client puts a
message on the queue, the broker then delivers the message to a worker.

A Celery system can consist of multiple workers and brokers, giving way
to high availability and horizontal scaling.

Celery is written in Python, but the protocol can be implemented in any
language. In addition to Python there's node-celery_ for Node.js,
and a `PHP client`_.

Language interoperability can also be achieved by using webhooks
in such a way that the client enqueues an URL to be requested by a worker.

Celery also defines a group of bundles that can be used
to install Celery and the dependencies for a given feature.

You can specify these in your requirements or on the ``pip``
command-line by using brackets. Multiple bundles can be specified by
separating them by commas.

The Code of Conduct covers our behavior as members of the community,
in any forum, mailing list, wiki, website, Internet relay chat (IRC), public
meeting or private correspondence.

The Code of Conduct is heavily based on the `Ubuntu Code of Conduct`_, and

"Be considerate
--------------

Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the
work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and
we expect you to take those consequences into account when making decisions.
Even if it's not obvious at the time, our contributions to Celery will impact

others work.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_k,celery_celery.xlsx,6,CONTRIBUTING

-------------

The Celery community and its members treat one another with respect. Everyone
can make a valuable contribution to Celery. We may not always agree, but
disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all
experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration
to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community
where people feel uncomfortable or threatened isn't a productive one. We

users of Celery.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_k,celery_celery.xlsx,7,CONTRIBUTING

----------------

Collaboration is central to Celery and to the larger free software community.
We should always be open to collaboration. Your work should be done
transparently and patches from Celery should be given back to the community
when they're made, not just when the distribution releases. If you wish
to work on new code for existing upstream projects, at least keep those
projects informed of your ideas and progress. It many not be possible to
get consensus from upstream, or even from your colleagues about the correct
implementation for an idea, so don't feel obliged to have that agreement
before you begin, but at least keep the outside world informed of your work,

"When you disagree, consult others
---------------------------------

Disagreements, both political and technical, happen all the time and
the Celery community is no exception. It's important that we resolve
disagreements and differing views constructively and with the help of the
community and community process. If you really want to go a different
way, then we encourage you to make a derivative distribution or alternate

"Other bugs
----------

Bugs can always be described to the :ref:`mailing-list`, but the best
way to report an issue and to ensure a timely response is to use the
issue tracker.

1) **Create a GitHub account**.

You need to `create a GitHub account`_ to be able to create new issues
and participate in the discussion.

you can open a github issue, please prepend the title with ``[QUESTION]``.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_k,celery_celery.xlsx,15,CONTRIBUTING

check if you have new information that could be reported to help
the developers fix the bug.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_k,celery_celery.xlsx,16,CONTRIBUTING
"4) **Check if you're using the latest version**.

A bug could be fixed by some other improvements and fixes - it might not have an
existing report in the bug tracker. Make sure you're using the latest releases of
celery, billiard, kombu, amqp, and vine.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_k,celery_celery.xlsx,17,CONTRIBUTING
"5) **Collect information about the bug**.

To have the best chance of having a bug fixed, we need to be able to easily
reproduce the conditions that caused it. Most of the time this information
will be from a Python traceback message, though some bugs might be in design,
spelling or other errors on the website/docs/code.

    A) If the error is from a Python traceback, include it in the bug report.

    B) We also need to know what platform you're running (Windows, macOS, Linux,
       etc.), the version of your Python interpreter, and the version of Celery,
       and related packages that you were running when the bug occurred.

    C) If you're reporting a race condition or a deadlock, tracebacks can be
       hard to get or might not be that useful. Try to inspect the process to
       get more diagnostic data. Some ideas:

       * Enable Celery's :ref:`breakpoint signal <breakpoint_signal>` and use it
         to inspect the process's state. This will allow you to open a
         :mod:`pdb` session.
       * Collect tracing data using `strace`_(Linux),
         :command:`dtruss` (macOS), and :command:`ktrace` (BSD),
         `ltrace`_, and `lsof`_.

    D) Include the output from the :command:`celery report` command:

        .. code-block:: console

            $ celery -A proj report

        This will also include your configuration settings and it try to
        remove values for keys known to be sensitive, but make sure you also
        verify the information before submitting so that it doesn't contain
        confidential information like API tokens and authentication
        credentials.

    E) You issue might be tagged as `Needs Test Case`. A test case represents
       all the details needed to reproduce what your issue is reporting.
       A test case can be some minimal code that reproduces the issue or
       detailed instructions and configuration values that reproduces
       said issue.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_k,celery_celery.xlsx,18,CONTRIBUTING
"6) **Submit the bug**.

By default `GitHub`_ will email you to let you know when new comments have
been made on your bug. In the event you've turned this feature off, you
should check back on occasion to ensure you don't miss any questions a
developer trying to fix the bug might ask.

Contributing features requiring additional libraries
====================================================

Some features like a new result backend may require additional libraries
that the user must install.

that require third-party libraries must be added.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_k,celery_celery.xlsx,77,CONTRIBUTING

    These are pip requirement files so you can have version specifiers and
    multiple packages are separated by newline. A more complex example could
    be:

Updating the version number
---------------------------

The version number must be updated three places:

    * :file:`celery/__init__.py`
    * :file:`docs/include/introduction.txt`
    * :file:`README.rst`

The changes to the previous files can be handled with the [`bumpversion` command line tool]
(https://pypi.org/project/bumpversion/). The corresponding configuration lives in
:file:`.bumpversion.cfg`. To do the necessary changes run:

"After you have changed these files you must render
the :file:`README` files. There's a script to convert sphinx syntax
to generic reStructured Text syntax, and the make target `readme`
does this for you:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make readme

Now commit the changes:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git commit -a -m ""Bumps version to X.Y.Z""

and make a new version tag:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git tag vX.Y.Z

   friendly.
*  Focus on security and easy auditability/review/rewriting of content.
*  Manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any
   software.
*  Allow module development in any dynamic language, not just Python.

1. The issue is reported.
2. The issue is verified and categorized by Vagrant collaborator(s). Categorization is done via GitHub tags for different dimensions (like issue type, affected components, pending actions, etc.)
3. Unless it is critical, the issue is left for a period of time, giving outside contributors a chance to address the issue. Later, the issue may be assigned to a Vagrant collaborator and planned for a specific release [milestone](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/milestones)
4. The issue is addressed in a pull request or commit. The issue will be referenced in the commit message so that the code that fixes it is clearly linked.
5. The issue is closed. Sometimes, valid issues will be closed to keep the issue tracker clean. The issue is still indexed and available for future viewers, or can be re-opened if necessary.

"### How to prepare

Once you're confident that your upcoming changes will be accepted:

* In your forked repository, create a topic branch for your upcoming patch.
  * Usually this is based on the master branch.
  * Checkout a new branch based on master; `git checkout -b my-contrib master`
    Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make focused commits of logical units and describe them properly.
* Avoid re-formatting of the existing code
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* If possible, submit tests along with your topic branch. It will help a lot to get your your patch / new feature accepted, and should prevent unwanted breaking changes to silently happen in future developments.
* Assure nothing is broken by running manual tests, and all the automated tests.",1,0,0,0,0,1,1,usp,student_k,mitchellh_vagrant.xlsx,11,CONTRIBUTING
"### Submit Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Open a PR to the original repository and choose the right original branch you want to patch (master for most cases).
* If not done in commit messages (which you really should do) please reference and update your issue with the code changes.
* Even if you have write access to the repository, do not directly push or merge your own pull requests. Let another team member review your PR and approve.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,usp,student_k,mitchellh_vagrant.xlsx,12,CONTRIBUTING
"### Pull Request Lifecycle

1. You are welcome to submit your PR for commentary or review before it is fully completed. Please prefix the title of your PR with ""[WIP]"" to indicate this. It's also a good idea to include specific questions or items you'd like feedback on.
2. Sign the [HashiCorp CLA](#hashicorp-cla). If you haven't signed the CLA yet, a bot will ask you to do so. You only need to sign the CLA once. If you've already signed the CLA, the CLA status will be green automatically.
3. The PR is categorized by Vagrant collaborator(s), applying GitHub tags similarly to issues triage.
4. Once you believe your PR is ready to be merged, you can remove any
  ""[WIP]"" prefix from the title and a Vagrant collaborator will review.
5. One of the Vagrant collaborators will look over your contribution and either provide comments letting you know if there is anything left to do. We do our best to provide feedback in a timely manner, but it may take some time for us to respond.
6. Once all outstanding comments have been addressed, your contribution will be merged! Merged PRs will be included in the next Vagrant release. The Vagrant contributors will take care of updating the CHANGELOG as they merge.
7. We might decide that a PR should be closed. We'll make sure to provide clear reasoning when this happens.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,usp,student_k,mitchellh_vagrant.xlsx,13,CONTRIBUTING

**pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data
structures designed to make working with ""relational"" or ""labeled"" data both
easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for

Tiled was originally written in Java. In 2008, work began to develop a faster,
better looking, and easier-to-use version of Tiled based on the Qt framework.

offered by the standard Java libraries.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_l,bjorn_tiled.xlsx,5,README

This code creates a scene, a camera, and a geometric cube, and it adds the cube to the scene. It then creates a `WebGL` renderer for the scene and camera, and it adds that viewport to the document.body element. Finally, it animates the cube within the scene for the camera.

var camera, scene, renderer;
var geometry, material, mesh;

init();
animate();

function init() {

	camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 70, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.01, 10 );

"### Contributing

We hope that you will consider contributing to Devise. Please read this short overview for some information about how to get started:

https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/Contributing

You will usually want to write tests for your changes.  To run the test suite, go into Devise's top-level directory and run `bundle install` and `bin/test`.
Devise works with multiple Ruby and Rails versions, and ActiveRecord and Mongoid ORMs, which means you can run the test suite with some modifiers: `DEVISE_ORM` and `BUNDLE_GEMFILE`.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_j,plataformatec_devise.xlsx,14,README
"### DEVISE_ORM
Since Devise support both Mongoid and ActiveRecord, we rely on this variable to run specific code for each ORM.
The default value of `DEVISE_ORM` is `active_record`. To run the tests for mongoid, you can pass `mongoid`:
```
DEVISE_ORM=mongoid bin/test

==> Devise.orm = :mongoid
```
When running the tests for Mongoid, you will need to have a MongoDB server (version 2.0 or newer) running on your system.

Please note that the command output will show the variable value being used.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_j,plataformatec_devise.xlsx,15,README
"### BUNDLE_GEMFILE
We can use this variable to tell bundler what Gemfile it should use (instead of the one in the current directory).
Inside the [gemfiles](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/tree/master/gemfiles) directory, we have one for each version of Rails we support. When you send us a pull request, it may happen that the test suite breaks on Travis using some of them. If that's the case, you can simulate the same environment using the `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` variable.
For example, if the tests broke using Ruby 2.4.2 and Rails 4.1, you can do the following:
```bash
rbenv shell 2.4.2 # or rvm use 2.4.2
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-4.1-stable bundle install
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-4.1-stable bin/test
```

You can also combine both of them if the tests broke for Mongoid:

"## Starting with Rails?

If you are building your first Rails application, we recommend you *do not* use Devise. Devise requires a good understanding of the Rails Framework. In such cases, we advise you to start a simple authentication system from scratch. Today, we have three resources that should help you get started:

* Michael Hartl's online book: https://www.railstutorial.org/book/modeling_users
* Ryan Bates' Railscast: http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch
* Codecademy's Ruby on Rails: Authentication and Authorization: http://www.codecademy.com/en/learn/rails-auth

Once you have solidified your understanding of Rails and authentication mechanisms, we assure you Devise will be very pleasant to work with. :smiley:",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_j,plataformatec_devise.xlsx,18,README
"## Getting started

Devise 4.0 works with Rails 4.1 onwards. Add the following line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'devise'
```

Then run `bundle install`

Next, you need to run the generator:

```console
$ rails generate devise:install
```
",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_j,plataformatec_devise.xlsx,19,README
"At this point, a number of instructions will appear in the console. Among these instructions, you'll need to set up the default URL options for the Devise mailer in each environment. Here is a possible configuration for `config/environments/development.rb`:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
```

The generator will install an initializer which describes ALL of Devise's configuration options. It is *imperative* that you take a look at it. When you are done, you are ready to add Devise to any of your models using the generator.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_j,plataformatec_devise.xlsx,20,README
"In the following command you will replace `MODEL` with the class name used for the application’s users (it’s frequently `User` but could also be `Admin`). This will create a model (if one does not exist) and configure it with the default Devise modules. The generator also configures your `config/routes.rb` file to point to the Devise controller.

```console
$ rails generate devise MODEL
```

Next, check the MODEL for any additional configuration options you might want to add, such as confirmable or lockable. If you add an option, be sure to inspect the migration file (created by the generator if your ORM supports them) and uncomment the appropriate section.  For example, if you add the confirmable option in the model, you'll need to uncomment the Confirmable section in the migration.

Then run `rails db:migrate`",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_j,plataformatec_devise.xlsx,21,README

Otherwise, you will run into strange errors, for example, users being unable to login and route helpers being undefined.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_j,plataformatec_devise.xlsx,22,README
"### Controller filters and helpers

Devise will create some helpers to use inside your controllers and views. To set up a controller with user authentication, just add this before_action (assuming your devise model is 'User'):

```ruby
before_action :authenticate_user!
```

For Rails 5, note that `protect_from_forgery` is no longer prepended to the `before_action` chain, so if you have set `authenticate_user` before `protect_from_forgery`, your request will result in ""Can't verify CSRF token authenticity."" To resolve this, either change the order in which you call them, or use `protect_from_forgery prepend: true`.

If your devise model is something other than User, replace ""_user"" with ""_yourmodel"". The same logic applies to the instructions below.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_j,plataformatec_devise.xlsx,23,README
"To verify if a user is signed in, use the following helper:

```ruby
user_signed_in?

You can access the session for this scope:

```ruby
user_session
```",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_j,plataformatec_devise.xlsx,24,README
"After signing in a user, confirming the account or updating the password, Devise will look for a scoped root path to redirect to. For instance, when using a `:user` resource, the `user_root_path` will be used if it exists; otherwise, the default `root_path` will be used. This means that you need to set the root inside your routes:

```ruby
root to: 'home#index'
```

You can also override `after_sign_in_path_for` and `after_sign_out_path_for` to customize your redirect hooks.

Notice that if your Devise model is called `Member` instead of `User`, for example, then the helpers available are:

```ruby
before_action :authenticate_member!

member_signed_in?

current_member

member_session

"### Configuring Models

The Devise method in your models also accepts some options to configure its modules. For example, you can choose the cost of the hashing algorithm with:

```ruby
devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable, :confirmable, :recoverable, stretches: 12
```

Besides `:stretches`, you can define `:pepper`, `:encryptor`, `:confirm_within`, `:remember_for`, `:timeout_in`, `:unlock_in` among other options. For more details, see the initializer file that was created when you invoked the ""devise:install"" generator described above.

* `sign_up` (`Devise::RegistrationsController#create`) - Permits authentication keys plus `password` and `password_confirmation`

If you have multiple Devise models, you may want to set up a different parameter sanitizer per model. In this case, we recommend inheriting from `Devise::ParameterSanitizer` and adding your own logic:

After doing so, you will be able to have views based on the role like `users/sessions/new` and `admins/sessions/new`. If no view is found within the scope, Devise will use the default view at `devise/sessions/new`. You can also use the generator to generate scoped views:

```console
$ rails generate devise:views users
```",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_j,plataformatec_devise.xlsx,38,README

```console
$ rails generate devise:views -v registrations confirmations
```",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_j,plataformatec_devise.xlsx,39,README
"### Configuring controllers

If the customization at the views level is not enough, you can customize each controller by following these steps:

1. Create your custom controllers using the generator which requires a scope:

    ```console
    $ rails generate devise:controllers [scope]
    ```

    If you specify `users` as the scope, controllers will be created in `app/controllers/users/`.
    And the sessions controller will look like this:

    ```ruby
    class Users::SessionsController < Devise::SessionsController
      # GET /resource/sign_in
      # def new
      #   super
      # end
      ...

"### Configuring multiple models

Devise allows you to set up as many Devise models as you want. If you want to have an Admin model with just authentication and timeout features, in addition to the User model above, just run:

```ruby
# Create a migration with the required fields
create_table :admins do |t|
  t.string :email
  t.string :encrypted_password
  t.timestamps null: false
end

# Inside your Admin model
devise :database_authenticatable, :timeoutable

# Inside your routes
devise_for :admins

# Inside your protected controller
before_action :authenticate_admin!

# Inside your controllers and views
admin_signed_in?
current_admin
admin_session
```",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_j,plataformatec_devise.xlsx,63,README
"Alternatively, you can simply run the Devise generator.

Keep in mind that those models will have completely different routes. They **do not** and **cannot** share the same controller for sign in, sign out and so on. In case you want to have different roles sharing the same actions, we recommend that you use a role-based approach, by either providing a role column or using a dedicated gem for authorization.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_j,plataformatec_devise.xlsx,64,README
"### ActiveJob Integration

If you are using Rails 4.2 and ActiveJob to deliver ActionMailer messages in the
background through a queuing back-end, you can send Devise emails through your
existing queue by overriding the `send_devise_notification` method in your model.

```ruby
def send_devise_notification(notification, *args)

If you enable the [Recoverable](http://rubydoc.info/github/plataformatec/devise/master/Devise/Models/Recoverable) module, note that a stolen password reset token could give an attacker access to your application.

Rails 5+ has a built-in [API Mode](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html) which optimizes Rails for use as an API (only).

"### Peer Review

Anyone may participate in peer review which is expressed by comments in the pull
request. Typically reviewers will review the code for obvious errors, as well as
test out the patch set and opine on the technical merits of the patch. Project
maintainers take into account the peer review when determining if there is
consensus to merge a pull request (remember that discussions may have been
spread out over GitHub, mailing list and IRC discussions).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,usp,student_j,bitcoin_bitcoin.xlsx,40,CONTRIBUTING

language is used within pull-request comments:

  - (t)ACK means ""I have tested the code and I agree it should be merged"", involving
    change-specific manual testing in addition to running the unit and functional
    tests, and in case it is not obvious how the manual testing was done, it should
    be described;
  - NACK means ""I disagree this should be merged"", and must be accompanied by
    sound technical justification (or in certain cases of copyright/patent/licensing
    issues, legal justification). NACKs without accompanying reasoning may be
    disregarded;
  - utACK means ""I have not tested the code, but I have reviewed it and it looks
    OK, I agree it can be merged"";
  - Concept ACK means ""I agree in the general principle of this pull request"";
  - Nit refers to trivial, often non-blocking issues.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_j,bitcoin_bitcoin.xlsx,41,CONTRIBUTING

"### Finding Reviewers

As most reviewers are themselves developers with their own projects, the review
process can be quite lengthy, and some amount of patience is required. If you find
that you've been waiting for a pull request to be given attention for several
months, there may be a number of reasons for this, some of which you can do something
about:

  - It may be because of a feature freeze due to an upcoming release. During this time,
    only bug fixes are taken into consideration. If your pull request is a new feature,
    it will not be prioritized until the release is over. Wait for release.
  - It may be because the changes you are suggesting do not appeal to people. Rather than
    nits and critique, which require effort and means they care enough to spend time on your
    contribution, thundering silence is a good sign of widespread (mild) dislike of a given change
    (because people don't assume *others* won't actually like the proposal). Don't take
    that personally, though! Instead, take another critical look at what you are suggesting
    and see if it: changes too much, is too broad, doesn't adhere to the
    [developer notes](doc/developer-notes.md), is dangerous or insecure, is messily written, etc.
    Identify and address any of the issues you find. Then ask e.g. on IRC if someone could give
    their opinion on the concept itself.
  - It may be because your code is too complex for all but a few people. And those people
    may not have realized your pull request even exists. A great way to find people who
    are qualified and care about the code you are touching is the
    [Git Blame feature](https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/). Simply
    find the person touching the code you are touching before you and see if you can find
    them and give them a nudge. Don't be incessant about the nudging though.
  - Finally, if all else fails, ask on IRC or elsewhere for someone to give your pull request
    a look. If you think you've been waiting an unreasonably long amount of time (month+) for
    no particular reason (few lines changed, etc), this is totally fine. Try to return the favor
    when someone else is asking for feedback on their code, and universe balances out.

The following exists as a way to set expectations for yourself and for the review process. We *want* to merge fixes and features, so let's describe how we can achieve this:",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_f,elasticsearch_logstash.xlsx,24,CONTRIBUTING

* To constantly make forward progress on PRs

* To have constructive discussions on PRs",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_f,elasticsearch_logstash.xlsx,25,CONTRIBUTING
"## Overarching Guiding Principles

Keep these in mind as both authors and reviewers of PRs:

* Have empathy in both directions (reviewer <--> reviewee/author)
* Progress over perfection and personal preferences
* Authors and reviewers should proactively address questions of pacing in order to reach an acceptable balance between meeting the author's expected timeline for merging the PR and the reviewer's ability to keep up with revisions to the PR.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_f,elasticsearch_logstash.xlsx,26,CONTRIBUTING
"## As a reviewee (i.e. author) of a PR:

* I must put up atomic PRs. This helps the reviewer of the PR do a high quality review fast. ""Atomic"" here means two things:
  - The PR must contain related changes and leave out unrelated changes (e.g. refactorings, etc. that could be their own PR instead).
  - If the PR could be broken up into two or more PRs either ""vertically"" (by separating concerns logically) or horizontally (by sharding the PR into a series of PRs --- usually works well with mass refactoring or cleanup type PRs), it should. A set of such related PRs can be tracked and given context in a meta issue.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_f,elasticsearch_logstash.xlsx,27,CONTRIBUTING
"* I must strive to please the reviewer(s). In other words, bias towards taking the reviewers suggestions rather than getting into a protracted argument. This helps move the PR forward. A convenient ""escape hatch"" to use might be to file a new issue for a follow up discussion/PR. If you find yourself getting into a drawn out argument, ask yourself: is this a good use of our time?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_f,elasticsearch_logstash.xlsx,28,CONTRIBUTING
"## As a reviewer of a PR:

* I must first focus on whether the PR works functionally -- i.e. does it solve the problem (bug, feature, etc.) it sets out to solve.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_f,elasticsearch_logstash.xlsx,29,CONTRIBUTING
"* Then I should ask myself: can I understand what the code in this PR is doing and, more importantly, why its doing whatever its doing, within 1 or 2 passes over the PR?

  * If yes, LGTM the PR!

  * If no, ask for clarifications on the PR. This will usually lead to changes in the code such as renaming of variables/functions or extracting of functions or simply adding ""why"" inline comments. But first ask the author for clarifications before assuming any intent on their part.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_f,elasticsearch_logstash.xlsx,30,CONTRIBUTING
* I must not focus on personal preferences or nitpicks. If I understand the code in the PR but simply would've implemented the same solution a different way that's great but its not feedback that belongs in the PR. Such feedback only serves to slow down progress for little to no gain.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_f,elasticsearch_logstash.xlsx,31,CONTRIBUTING

"## What is it?

**pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data
structures designed to make working with ""relational"" or ""labeled"" data both
easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for
doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has
the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data
analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on
its way towards this goal.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_f,pydata_pandas.xlsx,4,README

"Compatibility
-------------

 * **Minimum Android SDK**: Glide v4 requires a minimum API level of 14.
 * **Compile Android SDK**: Glide v4 requires you to compile against API 26 or later.

 If you need to support older versions of Android, consider staying on [Glide v3][14], which works on API 10, but is not actively maintained.

 * **OkHttp 3.x**: There is an optional dependency available called `okhttp3-integration`, see the [docs page][23].
 * **Volley**: There is an optional dependency available called `volley-integration`, see the [docs page][24].
 * **Round Pictures**: `CircleImageView`/`CircularImageView`/`RoundedImageView` are known to have [issues][18] with `TransitionDrawable` (`.crossFade()` with `.thumbnail()` or `.placeholder()`) and animated GIFs, use a [`BitmapTransformation`][19] (`.circleCrop()` will be available in v4) or `.dontAnimate()` to fix the issue.
 * **Huge Images** (maps, comic strips): Glide can load huge images by downsampling them, but does not support zooming and panning `ImageView`s as they require special resource optimizations (such as tiling) to work without `OutOfMemoryError`s.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_i,bumptech_glide.xlsx,13,README
"Build
-----
Building Glide with gradle is fairly straight forward:

 * **feature**: new behavior, bigger than enhancement, it gives more bang to Glide
 * **question**: no need to modify Glide to fix the issue, usually a usage problem
 * **reproducible**: has enough information to very easily reproduce, mostly in form of a small project in a GitHub repo
 * **repro-needed**: we need some code to be able to reproduce and debug locally, otherwise there's not much we can do
 * **duplicate**: there's another issue which already covers/tracks this
 * **wontfix**: working as intended, or won't be fixed due to compatibility or other reasons
 * **invalid**: there isn't enough information to make a verdict, or unrelated to Glide
 * **non-library**: issue is not in the core library code, but rather in documentation, samples, build process, releases
 * **v4**: problem originated in v4, or question about v4 (while v3 is in wide use)

*bug + enhancement: feature that doesn't work, but it's an edge case that either has a workaround or doesn't affect many users*",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,usp,student_i,bumptech_glide.xlsx,9,CONTRIBUTING

By default, Capybara uses the `:rack_test` driver, which is fast but limited: it
does not support JavaScript, nor is it able to access HTTP resources outside of
your Rack application, such as remote APIs and OAuth services. To get around
these limitations, you can set up a different default driver for your features.

```ruby
Capybara.default_driver = :selenium # :selenium_chrome and :selenium_chrome_headless are also registered
```

"However, if you are using RSpec or Cucumber, you may instead want to consider
leaving the faster `:rack_test` as the __default_driver__, and marking only those
tests that require a JavaScript-capable driver using `js: true` or
`@javascript`, respectively.  By default, JavaScript tests are run using the
`:selenium` driver. You can change this by setting
`Capybara.javascript_driver`.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_i,jnicklas_capybara.xlsx,33,README

RackTest is Capybara's default driver. It is written in pure Ruby and does not

directly with Rack interfaces, it does not require a server to be started.
However, this means that if your application is not a Rack application (Rails,
Sinatra and most other Ruby frameworks are Rack applications) then you cannot
use this driver. Furthermore, you cannot use the RackTest driver to test a
remote application, or to access remote URLs (e.g., redirects to external

`Capybara.exact` and the `exact` option work together with the `is` expression
inside the XPath gem. When `exact` is true, all `is` expressions match exactly,
when it is false, they allow substring matches. Many of the selectors built into
Capybara use the `is` expression. This way you can specify whether you want to
allow substring matches or not. `Capybara.exact` is false by default.

For example:

```ruby
click_link(""Password"") # also matches ""Password confirmation""
Capybara.exact = true
click_link(""Password"") # does not match ""Password confirmation""
click_link(""Password"", exact: false) # can be overridden

Using `Capybara.match` and the equivalent `match` option, you can control how

four different strategies built into Capybara:

1. **first:** Just picks the first element that matches.
2. **one:** Raises an error if more than one element matches.
3. **smart:** If `exact` is `true`, raises an error if more than one element
   matches, just like `one`. If `exact` is `false`, it will first try to find
   an exact match. An error is raised if more than one element is found. If no
   element is found, a new search is performed which allows partial matches. If
   that search returns multiple matches, an error is raised.
4. **prefer_exact:** If multiple matches are found, some of which are exact,
   and some of which are not, then the first exactly matching element is
   returned.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_i,jnicklas_capybara.xlsx,69,README

an Ajax request, which, when complete will add the *bar* link to the page,
clicking on the *bar* link would be expected to fail, since that link doesn't
exist yet. However Capybara is smart enough to retry finding the link for a
brief period of time before giving up and throwing an error. The same is true of
the next line, which looks for the content *baz* on the page; it will retry
looking for that content for a brief time. You can adjust how long this period

request causes the contents of `#sidebar` to change, which would update

=================

*  Have a dead simple setup process and a minimal learning curve.
*  Manage machines very quickly and in parallel.
*  Avoid custom-agents and additional open ports, be agentless by
   leveraging the existing SSH daemon.
*  Describe infrastructure in a language that is both machine and human
   friendly.
*  Focus on security and easy auditability/review/rewriting of content.
*  Manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any
   software.
*  Allow module development in any dynamic language, not just Python.
*  Be usable as non-root.
*  Be the easiest IT automation system to use, ever.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_i,ansible_ansible.xlsx,8,README

   kinds of ways to contribute to and interact with the project,
   including mailing list information and how to submit bug reports and
   code to Ansible.
*  All code submissions are done through pull requests to the ``devel`` branch.
*  Feel free to talk to us before making larger changes
   to avoid duplicate efforts. This not only helps everyone
   know what's going on, it also helps save time and effort if we decide
   some changes are needed.

#### Modifying Components

1. Locate the component(s) to modify inside `/core/src/components/`.
2. Take a look at the [Stencil Documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction/) and other components to understand the implementation of these components.
3. Make your changes to the component. If the change is overly complex or out of the ordinary, add comments so we can understand the changes.
4. [Preview your changes](#preview-changes) locally.
5. [Modify the documentation](#modifying-documentation) if needed.
6. [Run lint](#lint-changes) on the directory and make sure there are no errors.
7. [Build the project](#building-changes).

1. Run `npm start` from within the `core` directory.
2. A browser should open at `http://localhost:3333/`.

4. If a test showing your change doesn't exist, [add a new test or update an existing one](#modifying-tests).

"#### Modifying Documentation

1. Locate the `readme.md` file in the component's directory.
2. Modify the documentation **above** the line that says `<!-- Auto Generated Below -->` in this file.
3. To update any of the auto generated documentation below that line, make the relevant changes in the following places:
  - `Usage`: update the component's usage examples in the component's `usage/` directory
  - `Properties`, `Events`, or `Methods`: update the component's TypeScript file (`*.tsx`)

1. Locate the test to modify inside the `test/` folder in the component's directory.
2. If a test exists, modify the test by adding an example to reproduce the problem fixed or feature added.
3. If a new test is needed, the easiest way is to copy the `basic/` directory from the component's `test/` directory, rename it, and edit the content in both the `index.html` and `e2e.ts` file (see [Screenshot Tests](#screenshot-tests) for more information on this file).

"##### Screenshot Tests

1. If the test exists in screenshot, there will be a file named `e2e.ts` in the directory of the test.
2. A screenshot test can be added by including this file and adding one or more `test()` calls that include a call to `page.compareScreenshot()`. See [Stencil end-to-end testing](https://stenciljs.com/docs/end-to-end-testing) and existing tests in `core/` for examples.
3. **Important:** each `test()` should have only one screenshot (`page.compareScreenshot()`) call **or** it should check the expect at the end of each test. If there is a mismatch it will fail the test which will prevent the rest of the test from running, i.e. if the first screenshot fails the remaining screenshot calls would not be called _unless_ they are in a separate test or all of the expects are called at the end.
4. To run screenshot locally, use the following command: `npm run test.screenshot`.
    - To run screenshot for a specific test, pass the path to the test or a string to search for.
    - For example, running all `alert` tests: `npm run test.screenshot alert`.
    - Or, running the basic `alert` tests: `npm run test.screenshot src/components/alert/test/basic/e2e.ts`.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_m,driftyco_ionic.xlsx,18,CONTRIBUTING
"#### Building Changes

1. Once all changes have been made and the documentation has been updated, run `npm run build` inside of the `core` directory. This will add your changes to any auto-generated files, if necessary.
2. Review the changes and, if everything looks correct, [commit](#commit-message-format) the changes.
3. Make sure the build has finished before committing. If you made changes to the documentation, properties, methods, or anything else that requires an update to a generate file, this needs to be committed.

We also use the git commit messages to generate our [changelog](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). (Ok you got us, it's basically Angular's commit message format).

`type(scope): subject`",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_m,driftyco_ionic.xlsx,21,CONTRIBUTING
"#### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_m,driftyco_ionic.xlsx,22,CONTRIBUTING
"#### Scope
The scope can be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `action-sheet`, `button`, `menu`, `nav`, etc. If you make multiple commits for the same component, please keep the naming of this component consistent. For example, if you make a change to navigation and the first commit is `fix(nav)`, you should continue to use `nav` for any more commits related to navigation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_m,driftyco_ionic.xlsx,23,CONTRIBUTING
"#### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: ""change"" not ""changed"" nor ""changes""
* do not capitalize first letter
* do not place a period `.` at the end
* entire length of the commit message must not go over 50 characters
* describe what the commit does, not what issue it relates to or fixes
* **be brief, yet descriptive** - we should have a good understanding of what the commit does by reading the subject",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_m,driftyco_ionic.xlsx,24,CONTRIBUTING

----------------

Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_c,bitcoin_bitcoin.xlsx,3,README

"### Finding Reviewers

As most reviewers are themselves developers with their own projects, the review
process can be quite lengthy, and some amount of patience is required. If you find
that you've been waiting for a pull request to be given attention for several
months, there may be a number of reasons for this, some of which you can do something
about:

  - It may be because of a feature freeze due to an upcoming release. During this time,
    only bug fixes are taken into consideration. If your pull request is a new feature,
    it will not be prioritized until the release is over. Wait for release.
  - It may be because the changes you are suggesting do not appeal to people. Rather than
    nits and critique, which require effort and means they care enough to spend time on your
    contribution, thundering silence is a good sign of widespread (mild) dislike of a given change
    (because people don't assume *others* won't actually like the proposal). Don't take
    that personally, though! Instead, take another critical look at what you are suggesting
    and see if it: changes too much, is too broad, doesn't adhere to the
    [developer notes](doc/developer-notes.md), is dangerous or insecure, is messily written, etc.
    Identify and address any of the issues you find. Then ask e.g. on IRC if someone could give
    their opinion on the concept itself.
  - It may be because your code is too complex for all but a few people. And those people
    may not have realized your pull request even exists. A great way to find people who
    are qualified and care about the code you are touching is the
    [Git Blame feature](https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/). Simply
    find the person touching the code you are touching before you and see if you can find
    them and give them a nudge. Don't be incessant about the nudging though.
  - Finally, if all else fails, ask on IRC or elsewhere for someone to give your pull request
    a look. If you think you've been waiting an unreasonably long amount of time (month+) for
    no particular reason (few lines changed, etc), this is totally fine. Try to return the favor
    when someone else is asking for feedback on their code, and universe balances out.

Presto is a standard Maven project. Simply run the following command from the project root directory:

    ./mvnw clean install",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_c,facebook_presto.xlsx,4,README
"On the first build, Maven will download all the dependencies from the internet and cache them in the local repository (`~/.m2/repository`), which can take a considerable amount of time. Subsequent builds will be faster.

"## Running Presto in your IDE

### Overview

After building Presto for the first time, you can load the project into your IDE and run the server. We recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Because Presto is a standard Maven project, you can import it into your IDE using the root `pom.xml` file. In IntelliJ, choose Open Project from the Quick Start box or choose Open from the File menu and select the root `pom.xml` file.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_c,facebook_presto.xlsx,6,README
"After opening the project in IntelliJ, double check that the Java SDK is properly configured for the project:

* Open the File menu and select Project Structure
* In the SDKs section, ensure that a 1.8 JDK is selected (create one if none exist)
* In the Project section, ensure the Project language level is set to 8.0 as Presto makes use of several Java 8 language features",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_c,facebook_presto.xlsx,7,README
"Presto comes with sample configuration that should work out-of-the-box for development. Use the following options to create a run configuration:

* Main Class: `com.facebook.presto.server.PrestoServer`
* VM Options: `-ea -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M -XX:+UseGCOverheadLimit -XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent -Xmx2G -Dconfig=etc/config.properties -Dlog.levels-file=etc/log.properties`
* Working directory: `$MODULE_DIR$`
* Use classpath of module: `presto-main`",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_c,facebook_presto.xlsx,8,README
"The working directory should be the `presto-main` subdirectory. In IntelliJ, using `$MODULE_DIR$` accomplishes this automatically.

Additionally, the Hive plugin must be configured with location of your Hive metastore Thrift service. Add the following to the list of VM options, replacing `localhost:9083` with the correct host and port (or use the below value if you do not have a Hive metastore):

    -Dhive.metastore.uri=thrift://localhost:9083",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_c,facebook_presto.xlsx,9,README
"### Using SOCKS for Hive or HDFS

If your Hive metastore or HDFS cluster is not directly accessible to your local machine, you can use SSH port forwarding to access it. Setup a dynamic SOCKS proxy with SSH listening on local port 1080:

    ssh -v -N -D 1080 server

    -Dhive.metastore.thrift.client.socks-proxy=localhost:1080",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_c,facebook_presto.xlsx,10,README
"### Running the CLI

Start the CLI to connect to the server and run SQL queries:

Run a query to see the nodes in the cluster:

    SELECT * FROM system.runtime.nodes;

The Presto Web UI is composed of several React components and is written in JSX and ES6.

----------------

Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to

"### Finding Reviewers

As most reviewers are themselves developers with their own projects, the review
process can be quite lengthy, and some amount of patience is required. If you find
that you've been waiting for a pull request to be given attention for several
months, there may be a number of reasons for this, some of which you can do something
about:

  - It may be because of a feature freeze due to an upcoming release. During this time,
    only bug fixes are taken into consideration. If your pull request is a new feature,
    it will not be prioritized until the release is over. Wait for release.
  - It may be because the changes you are suggesting do not appeal to people. Rather than
    nits and critique, which require effort and means they care enough to spend time on your
    contribution, thundering silence is a good sign of widespread (mild) dislike of a given change
    (because people don't assume *others* won't actually like the proposal). Don't take
    that personally, though! Instead, take another critical look at what you are suggesting
    and see if it: changes too much, is too broad, doesn't adhere to the
    [developer notes](doc/developer-notes.md), is dangerous or insecure, is messily written, etc.
    Identify and address any of the issues you find. Then ask e.g. on IRC if someone could give
    their opinion on the concept itself.
  - It may be because your code is too complex for all but a few people. And those people
    may not have realized your pull request even exists. A great way to find people who
    are qualified and care about the code you are touching is the
    [Git Blame feature](https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/). Simply
    find the person touching the code you are touching before you and see if you can find
    them and give them a nudge. Don't be incessant about the nudging though.
  - Finally, if all else fails, ask on IRC or elsewhere for someone to give your pull request
    a look. If you think you've been waiting an unreasonably long amount of time (month+) for
    no particular reason (few lines changed, etc), this is totally fine. Try to return the favor
    when someone else is asking for feedback on their code, and universe balances out.

"Design Principles
=================

*  Have a dead simple setup process and a minimal learning curve.
*  Manage machines very quickly and in parallel.
*  Avoid custom-agents and additional open ports, be agentless by
   leveraging the existing SSH daemon.
*  Describe infrastructure in a language that is both machine and human
   friendly.
*  Focus on security and easy auditability/review/rewriting of content.
*  Manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any
   software.
*  Allow module development in any dynamic language, not just Python.
*  Be usable as non-root.
*  Be the easiest IT automation system to use, ever.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_o,ansible_ansible.xlsx,8,README
"Get Involved
============

*  Read `Community
   Information <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community>`_ for all
   kinds of ways to contribute to and interact with the project,
   including mailing list information and how to submit bug reports and
   code to Ansible.
*  All code submissions are done through pull requests to the ``devel`` branch.
*  Feel free to talk to us before making larger changes
   to avoid duplicate efforts. This not only helps everyone
   know what's going on, it also helps save time and effort if we decide
   some changes are needed.
*  Users list:
   `ansible-project <https://groups.google.com/group/ansible-project>`_
*  Development list:
   `ansible-devel <https://groups.google.com/group/ansible-devel>`_
*  Announcement list:

===========

*  Releases are named after Led Zeppelin songs. (Releases prior to 2.0
   were named after Van Halen songs.)
*  The ``devel`` branch corresponds to the release actively under
   development.
*  The ``stable-2.x`` branches exist for current releases.
*  Various release-X.Y branches exist for previous releases.
*  For information about the active branches see the
   `Ansible release and maintenance <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html>`_ page.

osquery exposes an operating system as a high-performance relational database.  This allows you to

browser plugins, hardware events or file hashes.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_o,facebook_osquery.xlsx,4,README

understand the expressiveness that is afforded to you by osquery, consider the following SQL
queries:

"## What is it?

**pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data
structures designed to make working with ""relational"" or ""labeled"" data both
easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for
doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has
the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data
analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on
its way towards this goal.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_o,pydata_pandas.xlsx,4,README
"## Main Features

You can configure youtube-dl by placing any supported command line option to a configuration file.

"For example, with the following configuration file youtube-dl will always extract the audio, not copy the mtime, use a proxy and save all videos under `Movies` directory in your home directory:

Note that options in configuration file are just the same options aka switches used in regular command line calls thus there **must be no whitespace** after `-` or `--`, e.g. `-o` or `--proxy` but not `- o` or `-- proxy`.

### Authentication with `.netrc` file

You may also want to configure automatic credentials storage for extractors that support authentication (by providing login and password with `--username` and `--password`) in order not to pass credentials as command line arguments on every youtube-dl execution and prevent tracking plain text passwords in the shell command history. You can achieve this using a [`.netrc` file](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/.netrc/info) on a per extractor basis. For that you will need to create a `.netrc` file in your `$HOME` and restrict permissions to read/write by only you:",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,25,README
"```
touch $HOME/.netrc
chmod a-rwx,u+rw $HOME/.netrc

After that you can add credentials for an extractor in the following format, where *extractor* is the name of the extractor in lowercase:
```
machine <extractor> login <login> password <password>
```
For example:
```
machine youtube login myaccount@gmail.com password my_youtube_password
machine twitch login my_twitch_account_name password my_twitch_password
```",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,26,README
"To activate authentication with the `.netrc` file you should pass `--netrc` to youtube-dl or place it in the [configuration file](#configuration).

"# FORMAT SELECTION

By default youtube-dl tries to download the best available quality, i.e. if you want the best quality you **don't need** to pass any special options, youtube-dl will guess it for you by **default**.

But sometimes you may want to download in a different format, for example when you are on a slow or intermittent connection. The key mechanism for achieving this is so-called *format selection* based on which you can explicitly specify desired format, select formats based on some criterion or criteria, setup precedence and much more.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,39,README
"The general syntax for format selection is `--format FORMAT` or shorter `-f FORMAT` where `FORMAT` is a *selector expression*, i.e. an expression that describes format or formats you would like to download.

**tl;dr:** [navigate me to examples](#format-selection-examples).

The simplest case is requesting a specific format, for example with `-f 22` you can download the format with format code equal to 22. You can get the list of available format codes for particular video using `--list-formats` or `-F`. Note that these format codes are extractor specific.

 - `bestvideo`: Select the best quality video-only format (e.g. DASH video). May not be available.
 - `worstvideo`: Select the worst quality video-only format. May not be available.

"For example, to download the worst quality video-only format you can use `-f worstvideo`.

If you want to download multiple videos and they don't have the same formats available, you can specify the order of preference using slashes. Note that slash is left-associative, i.e. formats on the left hand side are preferred, for example `-f 22/17/18` will download format 22 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 17 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 18 if it's available, otherwise it will complain that no suitable formats are available for download.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,43,README

"## youtube-dl coding conventions

This section introduces a guide lines for writing idiomatic, robust and future-proof extractor code.

Extractors are very fragile by nature since they depend on the layout of the source data provided by 3rd party media hosters out of your control and this layout tends to change. As an extractor implementer your task is not only to write code that will extract media links and metadata correctly but also to minimize dependency on the source's layout and even to make the code foresee potential future changes and be ready for that.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,121,README
"This is important because it will allow the extractor not to break on minor layout changes thus keeping old youtube-dl versions working. Even though this breakage issue is easily fixed by emitting a new version of youtube-dl with a fix incorporated, all the previous versions become broken in all repositories and distros' packages that may not be so prompt in fetching the update from us. Needless to say, some non rolling release distros may never receive an update at all.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,122,README
"### Mandatory and optional metafields

For extraction to work youtube-dl relies on metadata your extractor extracts and provides to youtube-dl expressed by an [information dictionary](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/7f41a598b3fba1bcab2817de64a08941200aa3c8/youtube_dl/extractor/common.py#L94-L303) or simply *info dict*.

 - `title` (media title)
 - `url` (media download URL) or `formats`",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,123,README
In fact only the last option is technically mandatory (i.e. if you can't figure out the download location of the media the extraction does not make any sense). But by convention youtube-dl also treats `id` and `title` as mandatory. Thus the aforementioned metafields are the critical data that the extraction does not make any sense without and if any of them fail to be extracted then the extractor is considered completely broken.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,124,README

That means that extraction should be **tolerant** to situations when sources for these fields can potentially be unavailable (even if they are always available at the moment) and **future-proof** in order not to break the extraction of general purpose mandatory fields.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,125,README

Say you have some source dictionary `meta` that you've fetched as JSON with HTTP request and it has a key `summary`:

"Assume you want to extract `summary` and put it into the resulting info dict as `description`. Since `description` is an optional meta field you should be ready that this key may be missing from the `meta` dict, so that you should extract it like:

Similarly, you should pass `fatal=False` when extracting optional data from a webpage with `_search_regex`, `_html_search_regex` or similar methods, for instance:

"### Provide fallbacks

When extracting metadata try to do so from multiple sources. For example if `title` is present in several places, try extracting from at least some of them. This makes it more future-proof in case some of the sources become unavailable.

"# EMBEDDING YOUTUBE-DL

youtube-dl makes the best effort to be a good command-line program, and thus should be callable from any programming language. If you encounter any problems parsing its output, feel free to [create a report](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/new).

From a Python program, you can embed youtube-dl in a more powerful fashion, like this:

```python
from __future__ import unicode_literals
import youtube_dl

ydl_opts = {}
with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
    ydl.download(['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc'])
```",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,144,README
"Most likely, you'll want to use various options. For a list of options available, have a look at [`youtube_dl/YoutubeDL.py`](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/3e4cedf9e8cd3157df2457df7274d0c842421945/youtube_dl/YoutubeDL.py#L137-L312). For a start, if you want to intercept youtube-dl's output, set a `logger` object.

Here's a more complete example of a program that outputs only errors (and a short message after the download is finished), and downloads/converts the video to an mp3 file:

```python
from __future__ import unicode_literals
import youtube_dl


class MyLogger(object):
    def debug(self, msg):
        pass

    def warning(self, msg):
        pass

    def error(self, msg):
        print(msg)


def my_hook(d):
    if d['status'] == 'finished':
        print('Done downloading, now converting ...')


ydl_opts = {
    'format': 'bestaudio/best',
    'postprocessors': [{
        'key': 'FFmpegExtractAudio',
        'preferredcodec': 'mp3',

    'logger': MyLogger(),
    'progress_hooks': [my_hook],

        git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/youtube-dl.git

3. Start a new git branch with

        cd youtube-dl
        git checkout -b yourextractor

6. Run `python test/test_download.py TestDownload.test_YourExtractor`. This *should fail* at first, but you can continually re-run it until you're done. If you decide to add more than one test, then rename ``_TEST`` to ``_TESTS`` and make it into a list of dictionaries.

"## youtube-dl coding conventions

This section introduces a guide lines for writing idiomatic, robust and future-proof extractor code.

Extractors are very fragile by nature since they depend on the layout of the source data provided by 3rd party media hosters out of your control and this layout tends to change. As an extractor implementer your task is not only to write code that will extract media links and metadata correctly but also to minimize dependency on the source's layout and even to make the code foresee potential future changes and be ready for that. This is important because it will allow the extractor not to break on minor layout changes thus keeping old youtube-dl versions working. Even though this breakage issue is easily fixed by emitting a new version of youtube-dl with a fix incorporated, all the previous versions become broken in all repositories and distros' packages that may not be so prompt in fetching the update from us. Needless to say, some non rolling release distros may never receive an update at all.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,26,CONTRIBUTING
"### Mandatory and optional metafields

For extraction to work youtube-dl relies on metadata your extractor extracts and provides to youtube-dl expressed by an [information dictionary](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/7f41a598b3fba1bcab2817de64a08941200aa3c8/youtube_dl/extractor/common.py#L94-L303) or simply *info dict*. Only the following meta fields in the *info dict* are considered mandatory for a successful extraction process by youtube-dl:

 - `id` (media identifier)
 - `title` (media title)
 - `url` (media download URL) or `formats`",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,27,CONTRIBUTING
In fact only the last option is technically mandatory (i.e. if you can't figure out the download location of the media the extraction does not make any sense). But by convention youtube-dl also treats `id` and `title` as mandatory. Thus the aforementioned metafields are the critical data that the extraction does not make any sense without and if any of them fail to be extracted then the extractor is considered completely broken.,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,28,CONTRIBUTING
[Any field](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/7f41a598b3fba1bcab2817de64a08941200aa3c8/youtube_dl/extractor/common.py#L188-L303) apart from the aforementioned ones are considered **optional**. That means that extraction should be **tolerant** to situations when sources for these fields can potentially be unavailable (even if they are always available at the moment) and **future-proof** in order not to break the extraction of general purpose mandatory fields.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,29,CONTRIBUTING
"#### Example

Say you have some source dictionary `meta` that you've fetched as JSON with HTTP request and it has a key `summary`:

```python
meta = self._download_json(url, video_id)
```",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,30,CONTRIBUTING
"Assume at this point `meta`'s layout is:

```python
{

    ""summary"": ""some fancy summary text"",
    ...
}
```",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,31,CONTRIBUTING
"Assume you want to extract `summary` and put it into the resulting info dict as `description`. Since `description` is an optional meta field you should be ready that this key may be missing from the `meta` dict, so that you should extract it like:

```python
description = meta.get('summary')  # correct
```

and not like:

```python
description = meta['summary']  # incorrect
```",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,32,CONTRIBUTING
The latter will break extraction process with `KeyError` if `summary` disappears from `meta` at some later time but with the former approach extraction will just go ahead with `description` set to `None` which is perfectly fine (remember `None` is equivalent to the absence of data).,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,33,CONTRIBUTING
"Similarly, you should pass `fatal=False` when extracting optional data from a webpage with `_search_regex`, `_html_search_regex` or similar methods, for instance:

```python
description = self._search_regex(
    r'<span[^>]+id=""title""[^>]*>([^<]+)<',
    webpage, 'description', fatal=False)
```",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,34,CONTRIBUTING
"With `fatal` set to `False` if `_search_regex` fails to extract `description` it will emit a warning and continue extraction.

You can also pass `default=<some fallback value>`, for example:

```python
description = self._search_regex(
    r'<span[^>]+id=""title""[^>]*>([^<]+)<',
    webpage, 'description', default=None)
```",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,35,CONTRIBUTING
On failure this code will silently continue the extraction with `description` set to `None`. That is useful for metafields that may or may not be present.,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,36,CONTRIBUTING
"### Provide fallbacks

When extracting metadata try to do so from multiple sources. For example if `title` is present in several places, try extracting from at least some of them. This makes it more future-proof in case some of the sources become unavailable.

#### Example

Say `meta` from the previous example has a `title` and you are about to extract it. Since `title` is a mandatory meta field you should end up with something like:

```python
title = meta['title']
```",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,37,CONTRIBUTING
"If `title` disappears from `meta` in future due to some changes on the hoster's side the extraction would fail since `title` is mandatory. That's expected.

Assume that you have some another source you can extract `title` from, for example `og:title` HTML meta of a `webpage`. In this case you can provide a fallback scenario:

```python
title = meta.get('title') or self._og_search_title(webpage)
```",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,usp,student_b,rg3_youtube-dll.xlsx,38,CONTRIBUTING

"### Long lines policy

There is a soft limit to keep lines of code under 80 characters long. This means it should be respected if possible and if it does not make readability and code maintenance worse.

By default, Capybara uses the `:rack_test` driver, which is fast but limited: it
does not support JavaScript, nor is it able to access HTTP resources outside of
your Rack application, such as remote APIs and OAuth services. To get around
these limitations, you can set up a different default driver for your features.

```ruby
Capybara.default_driver = :selenium # :selenium_chrome and :selenium_chrome_headless are also registered

leaving the faster `:rack_test` as the __default_driver__, and marking only those
tests that require a JavaScript-capable driver using `js: true` or
`@javascript`, respectively.  By default, JavaScript tests are run using the
`:selenium` driver. You can change this by setting
`Capybara.javascript_driver`.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,usp,student_b,jnicklas_capybara.xlsx,33,README

RackTest is Capybara's default driver. It is written in pure Ruby and does not

directly with Rack interfaces, it does not require a server to be started.
However, this means that if your application is not a Rack application (Rails,
Sinatra and most other Ruby frameworks are Rack applications) then you cannot
use this driver. Furthermore, you cannot use the RackTest driver to test a
remote application, or to access remote URLs (e.g., redirects to external

`Capybara.exact` and the `exact` option work together with the `is` expression

Capybara use the `is` expression. This way you can specify whether you want to
allow substring matches or not. `Capybara.exact` is false by default.

2. **one:** Raises an error if more than one element matches.
3. **smart:** If `exact` is `true`, raises an error if more than one element
   matches, just like `one`. If `exact` is `false`, it will first try to find
   an exact match. An error is raised if more than one element is found. If no
   element is found, a new search is performed which allows partial matches. If
   that search returns multiple matches, an error is raised.
4. **prefer_exact:** If multiple matches are found, some of which are exact,

clicking on the *bar* link would be expected to fail, since that link doesn't
exist yet. However Capybara is smart enough to retry finding the link for a
brief period of time before giving up and throwing an error. The same is true of
the next line, which looks for the content *baz* on the page; it will retry

Presto is a standard Maven project. Simply run the following command from the project root directory:

    ./mvnw clean install",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_b,facebook_presto.xlsx,4,README
"On the first build, Maven will download all the dependencies from the internet and cache them in the local repository (`~/.m2/repository`), which can take a considerable amount of time. Subsequent builds will be faster.

Presto has a comprehensive set of unit tests that can take several minutes to run. You can disable the tests when building:

"## Running Presto in your IDE

### Overview

After building Presto for the first time, you can load the project into your IDE and run the server. We recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Because Presto is a standard Maven project, you can import it into your IDE using the root `pom.xml` file. In IntelliJ, choose Open Project from the Quick Start box or choose Open from the File menu and select the root `pom.xml` file.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_b,facebook_presto.xlsx,6,README
"After opening the project in IntelliJ, double check that the Java SDK is properly configured for the project:

* Open the File menu and select Project Structure
* In the SDKs section, ensure that a 1.8 JDK is selected (create one if none exist)
* In the Project section, ensure the Project language level is set to 8.0 as Presto makes use of several Java 8 language features",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_b,facebook_presto.xlsx,7,README
"Presto comes with sample configuration that should work out-of-the-box for development. Use the following options to create a run configuration:

* Main Class: `com.facebook.presto.server.PrestoServer`
* VM Options: `-ea -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M -XX:+UseGCOverheadLimit -XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent -Xmx2G -Dconfig=etc/config.properties -Dlog.levels-file=etc/log.properties`

* Use classpath of module: `presto-main`",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,usp,student_b,facebook_presto.xlsx,8,README
"The working directory should be the `presto-main` subdirectory. In IntelliJ, using `$MODULE_DIR$` accomplishes this automatically.

Additionally, the Hive plugin must be configured with location of your Hive metastore Thrift service. Add the following to the list of VM options, replacing `localhost:9083` with the correct host and port (or use the below value if you do not have a Hive metastore):

"### Using SOCKS for Hive or HDFS

If your Hive metastore or HDFS cluster is not directly accessible to your local machine, you can use SSH port forwarding to access it. Setup a dynamic SOCKS proxy with SSH listening on local port 1080:
